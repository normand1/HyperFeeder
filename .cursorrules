  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive camelCase variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isActive, hasPermission).
  - Use camecase for directories and files (e.g., routers/userRoutes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  
  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
