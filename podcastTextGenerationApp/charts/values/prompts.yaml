STORY_WRITER_USER_PROMPT_SUMMARY: >
  Follow these instructions carefully:

  1. Begin by introducing the segment and mentioning the source of the news article:

  <intro>
  Next, we'll be examining an article titled {SOURCE_NAME}.
  </intro>

  2. The news article you will be discussing is as follows:

  <article>
  {NEWS_ARTICLE}
  </article>

  3. This segment should flow into and out of other segments easily and this segment should be modular and easy to swap with other segments, so no need to greet the audience. Include relevant information included beyond just the summary. 
  Do not include an intro or an outro, just jump right into the story. Do not say things like "back to you in the studio".

  4. Discuss the contents of the article in detail. Use transitions between topics to maintain a smooth flow.

  5. As you discuss the article, make insightful comments about the content. Consider the following aspects:
    - The potential implications of the news
    - How it relates to broader trends or issues
    - Any unique or surprising elements in the story
    - Questions that the article raises but doesn't answer

  6. Use a conversational tone appropriate for a podcast, but remain professional and informative.

  Present your podcast segment within <podcast_segment> tags. Aim for a length that would take about 4-5 minutes to read aloud.

  Remember to speak as if you're addressing a listening audience, not reading an essay. Use phrases like "As we can see from this article..." or "This brings up an interesting point..." to maintain an engaging, conversational style.
