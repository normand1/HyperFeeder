00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,140
at podcast index dot social. I'm
Adam curry here in the heart of

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,200
the Texas Hill Country and in
Alabama, the man who protects us

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,410
all for recursive Armageddon.
Say hello to my friend on the

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,150
other end, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Dave Jones.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,130
Dave Jones: The whole time for
the last five minutes, I've been

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,570
fiercely running around on my
desktop trying to clear since

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,160
I'm also live streaming, I'm
trying to clean up my video

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
streaming and no agenda to try
to go around and clear all the

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,500
stuff that other people are
supposed to see on my desktop.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
You do know that in my seat, my
private key for nostril was

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,390
sitting there all kinds of
really

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,440
Adam Curry: was that really.
You'll learn soon enough that

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,980
streaming, in addition to doing
a show is really a big

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,250
distraction. And you know, and
then people don't listen to what

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,980
you're saying. They're looking
at trying to write down your

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,150
private keys. You'll see you'll
see you'll see it's alright. I

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,720
we've all been through a day if
it's all cool. You know, I too

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,050
had to see you see me camera. I
mean, it's he's remember those

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,410
days

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,720
Dave Jones: 98

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,460
Adam Curry: The Empire cam from
my office in New York City. And

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,490
that was focused on the Empire
State Building. Well,

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,900
Dave Jones: this is all going to
result in just a you know, about

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,080
10 1015 minutes from now it's
just going to be a big Oh,

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,940
that's exactly what it's exactly
exactly what it's gonna be. I

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,730
will disappear and then I'll
come but just hang with me. I'll

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,750
come back. It's always

33
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,930
Adam Curry: OBS man. That thing.
Oh, kill your your processor.

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,010
Dave Jones: It's let's see, let
me let me let me look at where

35
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,710
I'm at right now. See you soon H
top.

36
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,899
Adam Curry: You know, when did
it become a thing? I remember it

37
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,349
was always just top and then h
top. And I'll admit H top is

38
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,019
pretty cool. You know, you can
filter it. So you can it's

39
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,419
pretty the colors are pretty
good. It has pretty color. So

40
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,359
I'll agree. Took me a while to
figure out you just hit Q to get

41
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:25,829
out. That's my

42
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,040
Dave Jones: first thing I always
try. It took me quite a

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,390
Adam Curry: while to figure that
one out.

44
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,480
Dave Jones: We're smoother
running smooth 35%.

45
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:43,260
Adam Curry: board only 30 only
35%. Not even 100%. Oh man, we

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,200
got so much to talk about and I
think we should bring in our

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,500
boardroom guests right away

Unknown: It's good. No,

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,930

True. Which is the same as not

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,660
not? Yes. Yeah. Right. Where you

65
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,230
I mean, like when you know, tiny
micro business, you can be

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,570
whatever you want, you can call
yourself anything.

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,990
Unknown: That is actually true.
And at some point, I will create

68
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,880
the company just to get tax
deductions.

69
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,320
Adam Curry: So Martin joined us
right at the very beginning

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,790
almost of this entire project
three years ago, and created pod

71
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,300
friend, which was a web based
podcast app, which a lot of

72
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,440
people really loved. And then he
divorced us. And he went off and

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,190
they found a woman and a child
and all this stuff. And then he

74
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,920
started developing games, and we
were like, you know, I'd written

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,400
them out of the will. It's like,
no, no, it's all right. He's

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,430
left us. And you're back. We
need a little update. Martin,

77
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,400
where have you been? What's been
going on and welcome back.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,060
Unknown: Well, first of all,
thank you and second of all,

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,940
yeah, I mean, it was quite a
break. And I think in the in the

80
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,740
start of like, I was working on
pot friend the first version and

81
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,810
and somehow I managed to burn
myself out a little bit. Just by

82
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,930
moving a little bit too fast
with the scissors.

83
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,930
Adam Curry: You poked yourself
in the eye. That's what

84
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,860
happened. Yeah,

85
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,000
Unknown: exactly. But no, but at
the same time I got to put

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,570
motion that work which, you
know, Oh, congratulations. Well,

87
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,880
thank you and and but of course
that just took a lot of my time

88
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,290
and then at the same time we we
bought a house. Me and my well

89
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,120
then girlfriend now wife and

90
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,270
Adam Curry: oh, there was a
wedding we I didn't. Dave did

91
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,050
you see an invite?

92
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,490
Dave Jones: I didn't I didn't I
would have said they would have

93
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,260
sent a gift. And yeah,

94
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,600
Adam Curry: if you were
registered anywhere I would have

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,790
sent you some, you know, like a
bread maker. That's like a

96
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,820
classic like, here's a bread
make sure that's what you need.

97
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,930
Unknown: flatware.

98
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,030
Wow, huh. i Yeah, he

99
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,280
Dave Jones: left money on the
table. Mark. That's right. Sure.

100
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,580
Unknown: Yeah, no, but yeah. And
then, kind of, it wasn't really

101
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,950
like something that I thought of
like, Oh, I'm gonna take a

102
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,140
break. Now. It was more like
just real life things. Like, as

103
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,420
I said, the house where
everything was wrong with the

104
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,240
house. You know, we bought it
and then Sunday night, like, Oh,

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,220
this is actually rats in the
house.

106
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,690
Adam Curry: Does a rat in the
kitchen? What am I gonna do?

107
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,410
Nice.

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,960
Unknown: Exactly. And yeah,
there was a lot of things to

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,690
fix. And we fixed it. It's, it's
good now.

110
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,960
Adam Curry: Now, you know,
you're in Copenhagen area?

111
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,130
Unknown: I am. Yeah, I'm just a,
what you call like the greater

112
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,220
Copenhagen area. So just just a
little bit outside the main main

113
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,920
city? Nice. Yeah. But yeah, and
then, you know, in the break, I

114
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,520
did work on Puffin. 2.0. Like I
didn't even know it was like the

115
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,460
2.0 at that point. But I just
realized that a lot of decisions

116
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,170
I've made was because it was the
first time I made like a cross

117
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,470
platform app like that, where it
was both on web and desktop,

118
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,140
and, you know, Android, and an
iOS. And suddenly I find out.

119
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,280
Now I've taken some decisions
that seem smart, but are really

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,580
for, like, enterprise companies
with, you know, 100 developers,

121
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,170
or 200. Developers, which is

122
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,880
Dave Jones: where you're used
to. I mean, that's, that's,

123
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,040
that's the life you live most of
the time, right?

124
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,550
Unknown: So so in my day to day
job, I'm actually not a

125
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,280
programmer anymore. Like I
that's my background

126
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:21,240
engineering. Oh, he's became a
management which, which, like, I

127
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,900
love programming, but now it's,
I don't think like it's get that

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,810
out of my system in the
evenings, programming and pod

129
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:35,700
friend. But yeah, I'm doing
like, working from scratch, you

130
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,160
know, that's a lot of decision,
suddenly, you can be like, Ah,

131
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,440
I'm going to use it different.
And getting a little bit

132
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,740
technical now, but state
management system and things

133
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,500
like that, and, and work this
new version. I mean, there's a

134
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,160
lot to be said about never
rebuilding something from

135
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,940
scratch, because there's so many
bugs where it's like, oh, like

136
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,540
this issue like that, you know,
that I'm fixing on iOS. I fixed

137
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,900
that two years ago in Division
One, but you encountered a lot

138
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,830
of the same things. But but the
foundation is just so much

139
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,470
stronger now. So I can move a
lot faster now. So

140
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,530
Adam Curry: now I need to ask,
are you what are you using?

141
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,080
Naughty fluffer? What does I
called Fluffy,

142
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:22,110
Unknown: fluffy. So sad. I think
it's, what does it flutter

143
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,690
flutter flutter. That's what I
was looking for. Yeah, but I'm

144
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,430
not, I'm not using that.
Actually. I'm using React. And

145
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,540
then I'm using, like an OS code
that's on the client side. And

146
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,210
then I'm for the desktop app,
I'm using something called

147
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,170
electron. And then for the
native apps, I'm using something

148
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:47,250
called Cordova, Apache Cordova
where you can basically take a

149
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,140
web app, and then compile it
into a native app. And then when

150
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,560
you need native capabilities,
then you bring in like either

151
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,470
plugins, or you write your own
way you then write the native

152
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,210
code, that means suddenly, you
know, 99% of the app, you know,

153
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,530
stuff, like showing a list of
podcasts, you don't need native

154
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,690
code for that. You don't need it
to be like, you know, pedal to

155
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,260
the metal and you know, every
inch of performance know that

156
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,450
you just need something cross
platform for that. And that's

157
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,350
what I do. So the only thing
that I really use native code

158
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,190
for is the audio and in the
future, things like

159
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,320
notifications, and probably if
I'm going to, you know, expand

160
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,620
into you know, CarPlay and
things like that. Maybe I need a

161
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,130
bit more.

162
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,300
Adam Curry: Now if I if I
recall, you were having issues

163
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,560
with Apple the first time around
getting your app approved. Did

164
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,690
you actually ever get it
approved at that time?

165
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:56,790
Unknown: I got close. Whoo.
Yeah. But But, but no, it never

166
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,450
got through the test flight. So
you know, I managed To talk to

167
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,900
maybe you know, 10 people at
Apple, you know, every time you

168
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,130
submit it, someone new is going
to look at your look at it and

169
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,470
give you a reason why it wasn't
approved. And, and every time I

170
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,150
got like, I think the nine first
reasons I got for, you know, not

171
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,110
approving it was, hey, you know,
this, you know, we can see you

172
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,520
also have web part friend.com.
And, you know, the app is to

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,410
say, Mr. That's the website. So
just be, you know, a website. So

174
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,780
it doesn't need to be an app.
And I'm like, Well, you can say

175
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,800
that about any app.

176
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,850
Adam Curry: Really, thanks,
douchebags. That's not very

177
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,750
cool. And of them.

178
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,680
Unknown: So it felt like I got
punished a bit for also having

179
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,360
the website. But But then in the
end, you know, I wrote, I wrote,

180
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,870
basically, you know, every
single time I wrote a new reason

181
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,710
why I thought, Hey, by it should
pass by and then it I think the

182
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,130
last attempt, it did actually go
by that hurdle. And then it

183
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,430
became something else that was a
problem. I can't even remember

184
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,810
it, like the screenshots not
matching the, the app or

185
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,840
something, because some of y'all
know, like, some marketing

186
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,190
material. And then, of course,
of course, you know, pod friend,

187
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,090
you know, I run with sis up. So
suddenly, the one screen doesn't

188
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:24,150
match what's actually in the
app. And yeah, but I do see

189
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,720
Apple actually less than II
loosening up a bit like they

190
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,490
they are trying to have a better
image, like also with

191
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,950
progressive web apps. Seems like
they are trying to make Safari

192
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,770
less of Internet Explorer. So

193
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,350
Adam Curry: what are they trying
to make it? And just better? You

194
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,660
mean? Is that is that an
improvement? less of an Internet

195
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,280
Explorer? I'm not quite sure
what Yeah,

196
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,260
Unknown: I can see, I can see
that they're trying to improve

197
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,760
it a lot. I mean, of course,
something's still taking time.

198
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,860
And I, the way I see it, it's
probably like an anti monopoly,

199
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,920
like thing that they're trying
to do. Because Oh, yeah, of

200
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,040
course, they've already been
pushed to, you know, allow some

201
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,810
apps from outside the App Store.
And I think this is an attempt

202
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,960
for them to say, oh, you know
what, you know, we can run any

203
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,460
progressive web app. So I think
they felt like they had to up

204
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,000
their game.

205
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,480
Dave Jones: Now, how far down
the stack? Did you go with the

206
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,960
rewrite? I mean, did you just go
from complete scratch? dynoed?

207
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,190
Like, the empty, empty project
level? Or did you?

208
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,580
Unknown: Yeah, I mean, empty
pocket, empty project level, but

209
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,720
then, because because they kind
of had to, because I used a

210
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,210
different both a different
framework for the interface. And

211
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,670
then I also use a different
framework for state management.

212
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,340
But, of course, there are some
things, you know, the whole, the

213
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,190
whole server side, I haven't
touched because all the API

214
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,220
endpoints are still there. And
that's why, you know, when Adam

215
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,740
said, hey, I can still use my
old view. So you know, that's

216
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,720
because the whole background was
the same. That was cool. Yeah.

217
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:10,170
And, of course, there are also
things where I started from

218
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,780
scratch, but then I, you know,
went into the old files copied a

219
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,260
bit of code and paste it in.
And, you know, it's not like, I

220
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,810
want to rewrite everything just
for the sake of rewriting

221
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,280
everything. But I did want to
consider like, did I do this the

222
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,280
right way, the last time? And if
yes, okay, well, then I can

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,400
reuse the code, but I wanted it
to be like a deliberate

224
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,870
decision, every single

225
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,010
Dave Jones: use subscribe to the
rewrite it three times

226
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,110
methodology. You know, the third
time is, like, right at once

227
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,360
you're gonna hate it right? It's
right at the second time,

228
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,050
realize, you know, man, if I'd
only done this, and the third

229
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,830
time's the charm.

230
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,810
Unknown: Yeah. So I fully buy
into that, if I'm getting paid

231
00:13:51,840 --> 00:14:00,000
to do it. Yes, because it
definitely does improve it. Like

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,100
I remember. You know, some of
the times when I've worked for

233
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,010
bigger companies, for example,
like the one I'm working for

234
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,260
now, you know, we did do that
where we, you know, really,

235
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,280
really thought hard about, like,
this function should be the best

236
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,820
it could be. And then, you know,
you rewrite it and couldn't be

237
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
shorter, couldn't be more clear,
and you can always improve it.

238
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,100
But when running with scissors
is like, I am like, Well, why

239
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,340
would I rewrite it as like, it's
a piece of software that, you

240
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,820
know, as long as it works, I
might never return to it. So,

241
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:39,120
yes, I would return to what I
see, you know, needs work. Like

242
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,580
for example, you know, the
current part friend 2.01 of my

243
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,530
co workers have designer he
offered to help out a bit and as

244
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,980
you know, he asked me, okay, so
now what do you feel strongly

245
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,260
about changing as like, well, I
don't feel strongly about

246
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,460
changing anything like I like
if, if there's something where

247
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,960
we can see it improvement. Well,

248
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,390
Adam Curry: then well, one of
the one of the things that you

249
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,750
did, which just blew my socks
off is the way you are

250
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,150
presenting transcripts.

251
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,060
Unknown: Oh, yeah. That was
actually funny. Like, it kind of

252
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,890
almost happened by, like, by
chance. But the people that

253
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,060
follow along on podcast index at
social, they might remember I

254
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,380
posted a screenshot like, Hey,
does anyone have ideas on how,

255
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,730
you know, this could be better?
And of course, some people did

256
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,880
reply, like and said, Hey, this
app does it well. And I looked,

257
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,240
and I was like, Yeah, it's fine,
but it's not.

258
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,850
Adam Curry: Oh, the F word.
Fine, fine.

259
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,370
Unknown: And then, and then I
saw like, hey, we have these

260
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,610
speakers and most of these
transcripts, like, why couldn't

261
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,730
it be like, you know, and I
thought about, like, a text or

262
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,560
messenger conversation. And then
I saw, hey, you know, these

263
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,010
names? Could I, you know, put
into Avataan, another person

264
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,890
tag, and I'm like, hey, you
know, almost all transcripts

265
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,770
that I look at, they have the
same name as speakers as in the

266
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,440
person tag, I can just pull in
the avatar. And then yeah, the

267
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,590
rest is history. I, I do plan
now to, you know, have some kind

268
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:25,500
of currently playing page where,
where you can see the

269
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,470
transcript, but then you can
also see, you know, during that

270
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,930
timeline that boosts that come
in, and when they come in, and

271
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,160
Adam Curry: you're going to show
Oh, you're going to show booths

272
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,330
like fountain does.

273
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,310
Unknown: I haven't seen how
fountain does it? It's been a

274
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,240
long time since I've

275
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,640
Adam Curry: okay, you're going
to surface them though. That was

276
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,890
put it that way you want to
surface? Yes. Okay.

277
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,069
Unknown: Yeah, Oscar actually
reached out to me about he had

278
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:55,379
an idea about how we could share
boosts comments together.

279
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,850
Adam Curry: The evil plan comes
true.

280
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,900
Unknown: But essentially, that's
actually that's, that would be

281
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,010
really cool. Because I think
that is one thing, like, maybe

282
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,790
not missing, but it would be a
very, very nice to have. Because

283
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,540
if I want to surface boosts, if
I can only show you know what's

284
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,940
coming through pod friend, of
course, then I'm missing a lot

285
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,560
of the ecosystem. And even if
pod friend was to get, you know,

286
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,770
popular, which of course, I hope
it does, then, you know, can I

287
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,560
was no doubt that, you know,
fountain would still be popular.

288
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,370
And and it would be nice if,
like if if the whole ecosystem

289
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,000
Bookshare?

290
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,220
Adam Curry: Well, this, this
brings me to an import. First of

291
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,090
all, I'd love it if you do it
the same way that that fountain

292
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,320
does it. I personally like
adding a service into the value

293
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,320
block split. And just so that
you know, so I send one, one 1%

294
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,970
to fountain and that activates.
Yeah, I think it actually

295
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,690
activates from any app that you
then boost from. Now it doesn't

296
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,990
it doesn't handle the I think
that's the way it was the way it

297
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,440
works.

298
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,500
Unknown: I mean, that makes make
sense, right? Because then they

299
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,930
also get a boost. I mean, the
only thing that I could have,

300
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,690
like the only thing I could have
against that is that when you

301
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,230
look at podcasting to kind of
defeat, I think you already have

302
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,110
12 people in there. And you
know, you keep adding more at

303
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,960
some point, you're almost going
to run out of splits. Well,

304
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,350
well,

305
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,329
Adam Curry: this is a different,
there's a couple issues here.

306
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,499
First of all, thank you very
much for sending me your wallet

307
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:34,349
information upfront. That forced
me to and this is for Steven B.

308
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:40,439
It's when you're when you're
using a general channel level

309
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:45,809
value block just for the show.
Or even if it's episode it

310
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,779
whenever you need to copy it to
another place copy your value

311
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,569
block currently in sovereign
feeds have to copy every single

312
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:55,979
one over individually. And I
royally screwed it up today. I

313
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:59,189
had dred Scott's wrong, I had
the boost bot, right, everything

314
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:04,919
all wrong. So I've been fixing
that on the fly while we were

315
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,369
talking. So I think that's now
fixed. But this kind of rolls

316
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,679
into that. And I love that
you're gonna be surfacing the

317
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,939
boosts. Let's just put that
privacy conversation aside for

318
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:18,419
now. That's something we can
talk about. Dave and I had a

319
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,699
conversation with the Bitcoin 24
people this week. And I just and

320
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,249
it's very relevant to what we're
talking about here. And I came

321
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,939
up with an idea, which I think
is it's a business, I always

322
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:33,239
love coming up with ideas for
businesses, other people can do,

323
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:37,319
because I'm not going to do it.
So we're talking about doing it.

324
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:40,799
It's very interesting.
Organizational structure, they

325
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,819
have their so we've talked to
the general manager, and the

326
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:49,319
production manager who produces
the entire event. But there's

327
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,529
apparently a different team,
what's the content team and we

328
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:56,939
will have to pitch to them in
order to get this session on the

329
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:59,789
schedule, which I'm not worried
about. Sounds like you know,

330
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,199
these geyser, they're all in,
they love the idea. But so we

331
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,419
still have to do that and that
I'm not not too worried about

332
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,449
it, and it probably includes me
writing something for the

333
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:12,419
Bitcoin magazine, all of that
will happen. But as we're

334
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:17,879
listening to them, they said,
you know, we tried to set up

335
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:21,209
with I think with with Oscar and
with fountain, we tried to set

336
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:25,649
up a live stream of the Bitcoin
2023 event in Miami, which I'm

337
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,489
going to presume was audio only.
And I'm just, I'm just gonna

338
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:32,309
leave the audio video, whichever
it is, I'm gonna leave that to

339
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,169
the side for one moment. Because
we're talking through this,

340
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,959
like, you know, we could
probably set this up, we've done

341
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:44,789
this with 100%, retro, where we
can have value blocks change, we

342
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:48,269
can have album art change, and
then all of a sudden, it hit me,

343
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:54,689
holy crap, this is a business
listen to this. If you could

344
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:58,799
have essentially a live
operator, even using something

345
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:06,509
as sovereign feeds, just like
when the live stream is going,

346
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,909
and I play a song and I switch
to the song and I hit this, I

347
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:15,959
activate it in, in my little
intro interface here, I activate

348
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:19,079
the value block. This is
something that could be done at

349
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:24,599
every single conference in the
world, where you make sure that

350
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,639
every speaker has a lightning
wallet compatible, of course,

351
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,419
now, I'm gonna leave how they
how they get into a value block

352
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,589
on the side here. But
essentially, the conference is

353
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,379
running someone's listening
live, you know, just like

354
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,619
someone is, is switching cameras
or doing whatever they have to

355
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,579
do. When the next speaker gets
on or the next panel, click

356
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:51,119
activate that block, bam, you've
got four different wallets for

357
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,589
the panel on stage. At that
point, all streaming Sats are

358
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:59,699
going through the the actual
messages that will be sent even

359
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:02,669
from the live audience can
surface in the apps or even

360
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:06,989
surface on the screens in the at
the event itself. This is a

361
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:13,169
whole new value for value
proposition for conferences.

362
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:17,159
When most people go to a
conference, you don't get paid.

363
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:20,759
Now all of a sudden, you can not
only get paid, you can have the

364
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:23,579
interaction from the audience,
people at home can see that you

365
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,309
don't have to be looking at
screens, you can come in on the

366
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:30,239
apps. I mean, this to me was
like, Oh, this is a business

367
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:35,339
here that would add to any live
production of any event. And to

368
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:38,549
have this surface live in the
apps I think is a winner.

369
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,300
Dave Jones: Why couldn't you
extend this the same concept to

370
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:55,380
web to webinars? Yes, like over
RSS, just over RSS. icon down

371
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,790
Adam Curry: exactly. Everything,
it's a whole new way of looking

372
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,020
at value for value and with the
lid protocol, with the streams.

373
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,630
Webinars a great idea with a
stream, it's streaming and

374
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,720
someone has to operate this
obviously, but that's you know,

375
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,230
maybe Steven B can quit his day
job and do this full time. And

376
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,260
then at the end the webinar
turns into we're recording and

377
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,470
all the value blocks are intact
in the right spot with his

378
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,230
beautiful synchronization
system.

379
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,900
Dave Jones: But through but
through podcast apps, just yes

380
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,590
or no pike you know yet you tune
in to this webinar or not

381
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,750
through zoom. But through pod
friends.

382
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,910
Adam Curry: Yes, exactly. And I
just got all hyped about I'm

383
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,600
like oh my god this this is this
is something completely new.

384
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:53,040
Now. What if anyone wants to do
this? October Bitcoin Amsterdam,

385
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,950
is when they'd like to do it and
the streaming you know, they,

386
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,730
they're gonna send out a stream.
I mean, that's not the hardest

387
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,060
part. It's, you know, setting
this up and collecting all the

388
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,280
info and getting you know,
getting people lightning

389
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,250
wallets. I'm sure. Moritz get
Alby would be delighted to help.

390
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,360
I mean, this is something this
is a two point a podcasting 2.0

391
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,030
business opportunity where once
again, love it. Everybody wins.

392
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,050
Everybody gets a point off of
this, including the app

393
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,890
developers

394
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:29,309
Dave Jones: ambitious said like
America's Got Talent.

395
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,250
Adam Curry: Well, you can, of
course you can do I mean, we can

396
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,670
extend that wherever you want to
go. But I think initially, just

397
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,480
to be able to have a panel. And
just so and this is partially,

398
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,120
I'm gonna get back to you here,
Martin, because you said hey,

399
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,040
why don't you do the you know,
if you want to put me in the

400
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,870
live block, and this is
something we should have done a

401
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,590
long time ago. But we had guests
upon guests and I felt it was

402
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,100
unfair for the previous week's
guests to not get the you know,

403
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,980
the booths from this week. So
now, since Dave and I did two

404
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,890
weeks in a row ourselves, we've
turned it around. So now the

405
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,870
guests will be in the car Aren't
live block. And cool. Yes. So if

406
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,320
you boost, if you boost right
now Martin gets, you know,

407
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,510
Martin gets included in the live
stuff,

408
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,840
Unknown: I must say that's
really motivational. I can

409
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,900
actually sit here and look at my
LP wallet and see the the SAT

410
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,690
streaming. That's it's a pretty
nice experience.

411
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,540
Dave Jones: So it is working
here you're seeing that it's

412
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,280
definitely working. Yeah, this
is

413
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,550
Adam Curry: this is hot, baby, I
love it. But think about how we

414
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,470
can blow the webinars,
conferences, anything. And of

415
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,900
course, you could pre program
Dave, you know, we have we have

416
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,320
the software for that. But I
think having and I'm not quite

417
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,930
sure how you do that, you know,
not everybody has, of course, a

418
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,060
feed. But I from what I
understand from the new

419
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:52,230
description of the value time
split tag is you don't even have

420
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,140
to have a feed. But as long as
you have someplace where there

421
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,810
were a lightning addresses
referenced, I'm not quite sure

422
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,200
of the technical parts of it.
But it seems like that should be

423
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,860
relatively easy to set up. And
then you know, next panel, it's

424
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,920
for people, they all have a
lightning wallet, they all get

425
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,670
this equal split, the moderator
might get a little bit more, you

426
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,640
know, of course, the venue, the
actual organizer of the event

427
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,460
gets a piece. There's a piece
leftover for the app, there's a

428
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,210
piece of leftover for the person
running this business. And for

429
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,680
the lightning wallets. I mean,
it can

430
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,970
Dave Jones: be here cotton gin,
screwing around. He says when

431
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,590
can I boost my president? That a
political political rallies?

432
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,450
Same thing? Same thing? That's
Yes, a campaign donation. I

433
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:47,400
mean, Hey, Ryan. This is

434
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,070
Adam Curry: rice. Rice, sexiest
sexy, the lit protocol, the lit

435
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,690
item, the live item tag really
brings a whole new category of

436
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,310
cool stuff to light.

437
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,620
Unknown: In you guys.

438
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,670
Dave Jones: Now, there's some
things. There's some things that

439
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,420
are needed for that though, like
what one one thing is we so

440
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,960
we're gonna, we're gonna have to
push this. We're gonna have to

441
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,420
push this idea there that?

442
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,930
Adam Curry: Well, here's the
here's the target. And then the

443
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,310
target is Bitcoin. Amsterdam,
October. Those guys are

444
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,880
completely open. They're virgin.
They're blank slate. They're

445
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,780
jacked about, and we don't need
any permission from the whole

446
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,430
Starfleet Command over there. It
sounds like our producer of

447
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,390
what's his name? Scott, I think,
who does the production of the

448
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,230
events? Sounds like he was like,
how do we get this going? So we

449
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,980
can we can make this happen
quite easily as long as we can

450
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,390
put all the pieces in place.

451
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,800
Dave Jones: So that the issue
that I see it, this is not an

452
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,080
issue that stops any of this.
But there's a couple there's a

453
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,860
couple things here that bring
that that come to mind. So

454
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,700
firstly, we need the price and I
will take this as my as my duty.

455
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,480
We need a an explainer a
comprehensive thing that shows

456
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,800
exactly how to do this. It
because because I'm impressed

457
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,380
that you just read the value
time split and understood it.

458
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,330
Because it is I was I rewrote
and rewrote the wording. They're

459
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,950
using what Alex had put together
a ridge initially, and was just

460
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,520
trying to tweak more language
here and there. It is a

461
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,310
difficult thing to explain.
First of all, I

462
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,040
Adam Curry: feel I'm very
flattered that you are impressed

463
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,990
that I understood what you
wrote. But

464
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,100
Dave Jones: I'm impressed
because I read it and I didn't

465
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,360
understand it. Like,

466
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:53,099
Unknown: did you rewrite it
three times Dave?

467
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,940
Dave Jones: Did not reread it?
Well, of course, I read it

468
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,380
probably 16 times I

469
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,940
Adam Curry: read it and
immediately went, Well, how come

470
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,280
I can't do recursion? Which
everyone was laughing like, Oh,

471
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,100
I see why. Yeah, that could be
that could cause a problem.

472
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,260
Dave Jones: This is because I
know how I know how the thing

473
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,670
works. And um, but maybe it's
all the years of helpdesk work

474
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,500
or whatever that is. I'm reading
this and I'm like, no, no,

475
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,710
nobody, no human is going to
understand this unless you

476
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,820
already know what it does.
Right. And so I think I even

477
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,340
wrote in the spec. This thing
needs, there's going to be an

478
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,880
explainer for it because we were
I wrote that blog post a while

479
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,200
back about how to do live. But
really, really, I mean, so much

480
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,200
has changed now. There really
needs to be a dedicated

481
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,920
document. That's sort of like
between a spec in England and

482
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,980
Adam Curry: a manual. Yeah,
well, yeah, yeah. Joe. So

483
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,050
Stephen B, of course already
said tell me what you need. I'll

484
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,280
have a bill by the end of the
week. Okay. Yeah. Obviously, but

485
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,490
his production tool is pretty
much already there. I mean, what

486
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,930
I'd say is, I would need a way
to put in lightning addresses.

487
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,810
So right now he has albums, and
then you know, it automatically

488
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:18,180
propagates the value block. So
to be able to just use the same

489
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,880
interface, you have to see
sovereign feeds.com To

490
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,400
understand what I'm talking
about. But to have it, you know,

491
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,950
just say, Okay, here's a list of
lightning, lightning addresses.

492
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,910
And I can just select them the
same way. And then I can

493
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:38,640
activate the value block or
whatever I mean, it, it fits

494
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,740
within the spec, the way I
understood, it doesn't

495
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,420
necessarily have to be an RSS
feed. It's a it's a remote item.

496
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,130
Correct. Okay, so that does not
have to be an RSS feed, or did I

497
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,090
misunderstand that?

498
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,280
Dave Jones: I don't know, what
you mean by does not have to be

499
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,840
an RSS feed. Okay, so

500
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,850
Adam Curry: where do you get the
information from? So when I'm

501
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:06,060
playing a song, the information
for that value block for that

502
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,640
song is in its RSS feed? For
remote value? Yeah, the value

503
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,530
block. Right. Now, if I have
four speakers on a panel, how do

504
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,130
I put them into a into a
complete value block?

505
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,340
Dave Jones: Okay, yes. Okay.
That's what you mean. So that,

506
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,940
yes, there's two, there's two,
the two functions for the value

507
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,360
time split time, the value time
split tag. We're very we're

508
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,470
veering into, you understand
we're veering into fifth

509
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,270
namespace talk here. So

510
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,110
Adam Curry: is it hot and sexy?
Because then you know, then we

511
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:46,890
complain. And now it's time for
a namespace talk, not just som

512
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,560
namespace talk. It's hot, hot,

513
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,040
Unknown: hot, hot. Hot namespace
talk.

514
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,130
Dave Jones: I mean, it even has
the word split in it. So yes.

515
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:06,780
The, the name the value time
split tag as to possible

516
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,770
children, that one, it can, it
can take either a remote item

517
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,030
tag, which would reference
another feed somewhere else, or

518
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:24,240
it can directly except value,
value recipient tags. So you can

519
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,950
go you can just be statically,
put those in, or you can

520
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,560
reference a remote item where
it's done. And that would be

521
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,310
dynamic on the fly. Because it's
dynamic on the fly. Look up. I

522
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,810
mean, right? Yeah. So you've got
you can go either way with it

523
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,470
for the webinar, or thing or
webinar or whatever, live live

524
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,950
stream. It can be a mix of both.
I mean, like, if you're playing,

525
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:53,220
if obviously, if you're doing a
live, live show on the stage at

526
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,030
blah, blah, blah, and you decide
to play music, well, then you

527
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,580
can reference a remote item of
the feed that that musics coming

528
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,050
from. If you were just in then
if after that a speaker comes on

529
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,170
stage and begins to talk. It
could just be a static value

530
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,820
recipient block for that
speaker.

531
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,300
Adam Curry: Gotta gotta gotta
you gotta go. Okay, perfect. So,

532
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,580
yes, we need to write that up.
Yep. Yep. It would be great if

533
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,020
we can figure out and I guess
Dave, you and I will talk to the

534
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:27,450
Bitcoin 24 Production guys about
getting this going. And, and

535
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,060
then we'll see, you know, who
raises their hand? I mean,

536
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,830
whoever will need someone to,
you know, to operate the system

537
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,980
during the conference, which can
be multiple people, of course.

538
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,900
And, and again, you know, it's
like everybody gets I think, if

539
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:51,660
you have an audience, especially
Bitcoin people, and, and they

540
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,340
have up on, you know, they have
a sessions going on, and it

541
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:05,700
says, you know, use a podcasting
2.0 app. And if they also have a

542
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,770
screen or something where
they're showing the booster

543
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:12,540
grams, and I think this that
would be kind of off the hook.

544
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,440
Dave Jones: If it would bring in
I think it would break things.

545
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,710
Yes.

546
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,559
Adam Curry: I think it's a no,
no, I think it's a money making

547
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,709
trains, I think it will break
brands, I think it's a money

548
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,939
making opportunity. People will
get it, that audience will get

549
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:31,259
it and conference organizers,
everywhere. We'll get it the

550
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:34,019
number one thing is your
speaker's speaker, you know if

551
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,839
that if you're not promoting
something, if you're not being

552
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:41,879
if you're if you're not being
sent by your company, to show

553
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:46,799
something, which is probably a
good 70% of the speakers. But

554
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:50,069
other people just show up, you
know, maybe they get comped for

555
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:54,299
the for the attendance fee. But
to actually get value from the

556
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:58,139
audience while you're doing
this, hello, this is my life,

557
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:02,369
and doesn't matter if it's 10
days dollars, or $10,000, the

558
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:06,509
fact that someone is feeding
back in real time, and maybe

559
00:35:06,509 --> 00:35:09,959
while I'm speaking, I can have
my screen open right there and

560
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:14,129
see what's coming in. Questions
from the audience, anyone?

561
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:19,619
Dave Jones: Well, we I think we
need here. Here's part two of

562
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:25,469
this. I think I texted you this
morning, I think we need to make

563
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:29,339
as part of this whole thing. So
it's yes, a real push for Bo

564
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,460
Adam Curry: Boyle. And this will
make it happen at that

565
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,360
conference.

566
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,270
Dave Jones: And I can tell you
and let me tell you why. Because

567
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,440
I don't know if you saw strikes
announcement of like, Dave

568
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,140
completely reengineered their
their infrastructure?

569
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,090
Adam Curry: No, I haven't. Yeah,
I think this

570
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,000
Dave Jones: maybe was posted
today or yesterday it's been

571
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,290
within the last day or so.
They've they've done a complete

572
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,120
overhaul, they now custody,
their own their own coins, bank,

573
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,790
Bitcoin, they have new banking
part, getting rid of plaid. Oh,

574
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,820
good. Tons of stuff was about

575
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,290
Adam Curry: time that got rid of
plaid.

576
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,990
Dave Jones: Yeah, they're doing
tons of stuff there. And one of

577
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,380
the things is, they're making it
where you can spend, when you

578
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,090
send somebody money or receive
money, that those funds can

579
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,570
either go into or come out of
your cash balance or your

580
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,580
Bitcoin balance, it's
interchangeable, they're all the

581
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,360
same. They're doing a lot of
stuff here. And this is the

582
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,130
perfect the but the issue is if
I want to use my stripe wallet,

583
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,640
as my way to receive receive
value for value sets, through a

584
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,140
pilot through EMET as a
podcaster, I can't I can't

585
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,570
generate invoices for all those
things. It's not it's not

586
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,310
feasible, right. So the what
what in in, and I have a really

587
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,100
hard time believing that striker
is going to implement keys and

588
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,170
in keys and reset, you know,
receiving, because that means

589
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,840
they would have to have a
custom, custom key custom value

590
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,350
for every wallet and all that
kind of stuff. And so what the

591
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,510
proper fix for this is both 12

592
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,570
Adam Curry: Yes, exactly. That
gets all that stuff out of the

593
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:09,900
way.

594
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:12,869
Dave Jones: Yeah, cuz it can
generate invoices. So you, if

595
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:16,709
you if you put in bolt, what if
it's, if everybody adopts Bolt

596
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:21,599
12 you can it's really
reasonably reusable invoice,

597
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,019
right? You can generate it once
it's tied to your strike account

598
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,299
or your cash app account or
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

599
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:32,699
you blah, blah, blah. And then
all of a sudden, everybody can

600
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,109
use their own thing for

601
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,660
Adam Curry: Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, it

602
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,750
Dave Jones: opens the field way
up and makes this a whole lot

603
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,140
easier,

604
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,240
Adam Curry: we'll do that that's
a part of it, that that will be

605
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,040
a part of and that'll be a part
of the pitch.

606
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,370
Dave Jones: We're affected. We,
if there's one thing that we are

607
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,480
good at, we are effective users
of shame, and I think we can

608
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,140
employ that

609
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,530
Adam Curry: degree. That's
right. I do shame on you.

610
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,960
Dave Jones: We can deploy that
strategy.

611
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,960
Adam Curry: Well, also, to be
even more fair about it. I mean,

612
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,510
we're doing things we were the
first I would say lightning

613
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,990
project to really get people to
part with their Bitcoin on a

614
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,460
consistent basis. Yeah, not even
from purchasing something per

615
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,300
se. And we are still, as far as
I know, really one of the few

616
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,960
who have really implemented
micro payments, which is not

617
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,140
even on the lightning labs radar
anymore. You know, like, well,

618
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,800
how can we send, you know, big,
big money and how can we make it

619
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,910
USD?

620
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,420
Dave Jones: Z for feet Z for V?
stats.com? Yes, shorts. Yeah.

621
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,870
But yeah, like my favorite thing
was that was when, when you

622
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,450
brought that up in the Bitcoin
ran the lightning roundtable,

623
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,640
and they said, Well, you're
probably just gonna have to send

624
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,590
bigger payments. No, yeah,

625
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,110
Adam Curry: that that was that
was actually quite lame. When

626
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,760
that would that came back as the
answer.

627
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,860
Dave Jones: Yeah, no, this is
this is a fantastic idea. I love

628
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,850
I love this. Wow, incoming.

629
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,030
Adam Curry: I haven't looked at
the Go ahead, Martin. I'm sorry.

630
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,050
Yeah, I

631
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,930
Unknown: was just thinking, you
know, you know, we're talking

632
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,310
about podcasting. 2.0 apps, but
why not make a, you know, a

633
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,460
specific conference app, you
know, both for hosts. And for

634
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,310
the attendees, you know, that
only shows to speaks, you know,

635
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,570
you can attend play, you

636
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,620
Adam Curry: know why? Because we

637
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,180
Unknown: can delete the use of
it.

638
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,750
Adam Curry: We can even make a
music specific app. So I'm not

639
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,330
gonna I'm not gonna hang around
waiting for that to happen.

640
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,860
Personally. I think we haven't.
We have the we have the

641
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,960
infrastructure. Of course,
someone could do that, of

642
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,530
course. But let's not wait for
it. We have podcast apps that do

643
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,120
that do this. I mean, we also
didn't make a live only app for

644
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,000
for the live stuff. You know,
it's all within the podcast app.

645
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,880
So I think we have the
infrastructure ready to go.

646
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,820
Dave Jones: We can definitely
put a new note on that note and

647
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,180
Martin we can definitely put a
new medium type in there. That's

648
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,100
Adam Curry: what I'm saying.
Yeah, that's what I mean. I

649
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,890
Unknown: mean, I mean, you Note,
you know, I certainly imagined

650
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:05,880
that some point, you know, at
the top or bottom or side of pot

651
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,150
friend note, you will be able to
switch between music and

652
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,270
podcasts and then imagine you
can just go into options or

653
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,330
even, you know, have a different
version of pot friend that's

654
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,400
called, you know, no conference
friend.

655
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,360
Adam Curry: Short, medium,
Martin. So, come on Viking, we

656
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,550
know what you're doing. You're
setting up your business

657
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,030
already, you know, conference
friend, yes. I have a new app

658
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,260
I'm building Yeah, we know, it's

659
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,530
Unknown: just the main

660
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,120
Adam Curry: move faster, what
else is gonna do it? And well,

661
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,400
this, this brings up one other
point, which is important. The

662
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,710
last song that we played on
podcasting 2.0, which we did

663
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:55,380
with the value time split, was
Cory Keller. And as I and a lot

664
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,620
of other people noticed, it
didn't move the needle on it in

665
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,190
Wave lake. And that is because
it's self hosted, which is

666
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,120
completely valid. And the only
bummer about that I don't really

667
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,750
care too much about the chart.
But the bummer was, I have as

668
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,860
the as the broadcaster as the
facilitator of this. I have no

669
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,330
idea how well that was received
by the audience. And I know

670
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:24,300
we've talked about it before.
But when we switch the value

671
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:30,150
block, I need to have some way
of seeing that in heli pad or

672
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,290
some I need to be able to know
that this went to this block.

673
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,400
And that's what this stream is
streaming payment or forget that

674
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,880
what this booster booster gram
was for? I know we've talked

675
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,080
about it, but it doesn't seem to
have there's nothing to nothing.

676
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,680
Nothing happened. The hell it's
like we talked about it.

677
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,540
Where's, where's the proof?

678
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,590
Dave Jones: I liked it. I liked
it. That's how this goes. We

679
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,840
discussed it. And it didn't it
didn't happen.

680
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,690
Adam Curry: Whenever we talked
about something, Stephen B

681
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,970
always makes it happen. So I
don't understand what happened.

682
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,990
What needs to be done for that
to work. Is it possible? I mean,

683
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,550
it's not about a chart I'm not
interested in in top 40s. I

684
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,720
mean, it's fun to have. But it's
more, it's more important that

685
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:20,940
as a as a as a podcast, as a
podcaster. I can see oh, you

686
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,960
know, I'm really happy that this
guy, you know, got 100,000 sets

687
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,900
of words, here's the messages he
got or whatever. I just want to

688
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,320
know I hadn't, I have no
feedback, whereas the artist has

689
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,390
a feedback, but I don't have the
feedback.

690
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,160
Dave Jones: Now, it can happen.
It can happen. I'll make it

691
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,550
happen.

692
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,160
Adam Curry: Can you just tell me
how that works? How will you

693
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,820
make it happen?

694
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,430
Dave Jones: I'll write the code
for it.

695
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,570
Adam Curry: But where is the
where's the code have to live?

696
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,470
Is that is that code unhealthy
pad or is that? Oh, it's just an

697
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,760
okay. So it's not the way we're
sending it? It's it's how it's

698
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,600
being parsed?

699
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,500
Dave Jones: Well, it's well,
it's all that I mean, like if

700
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:07,440
the So hello, hello, Pat just
needs to be modified in order to

701
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,050
help it needs to be modified in
order to see the new, the new

702
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,320
components of the TLV record.
It's not exposing that to you.

703
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,320
That's that's the problem. God
so so you're not you're not

704
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,180
seeing the new information. And
that that's just something I

705
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,740
just had to get in there and do
it.

706
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,310
Unknown: Is there any
information in the TLB that

707
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,240
that, you know, signals that
hey, this was sent back to this

708
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,210
podcast, but on behalf of
another podcast? That's

709
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,350
Dave Jones: it? It is yeah, it
is. We put that in there and

710
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,220
meet let me see if I can find
it. Is blipped in. And that's

711
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,210
part of the

712
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,310
Adam Curry: sausage. There's
some additional stuff coming

713
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,810
through the TLV record.

714
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,330
Dave Jones: Yeah, that's in the
namespace. Now, Martin.

715
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,970
Adam Curry: Let me get with it.
Martin for you.

716
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,520
Unknown: Where you been Mario's
you know, I implemented the

717
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,790
value at Sam's player. And I
think I forgot that details. So

718
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,470
you know, people that are
getting the boost, they will

719
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,070
just it will look like any boost
that's coming through. So that's

720
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,480
something I'll have to add

721
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,630
Dave Jones: on that page right
now. So let me find out. Let me

722
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,570
let me get it for you. Okay, so
here it is. So there we added

723
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:18,690
two new optional fields in the
TLV. And one is called remote

724
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:23,010
feed Gu ID and string and the
other one's called Remote item.

725
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,460
Good. That's it. It's sometimes
the payment will be sent to a

726
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,820
feed value but because a
different feed referenced it in

727
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,700
a pack podcast value time split
tag, when that happens, this

728
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,520
field will contain the GUID of
the referencing feed.

729
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,500
Adam Curry: And I really love
this and anyone who's

730
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,640
implementing blit I hope you all
do that. Because there's

731
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,240
something came up that just
switching topics a little bit

732
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,890
here. You know, Tucker Carlson
very famous American television

733
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,070
host he got fired from his job
for whatever reasons. It's all

734
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,360
political, not important. But he
started posting on Twitter. Are

735
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:05,700
and I find it highly irritating
that you know there's a little

736
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,380
number on there there and says
125 million views. And people

737
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,030
like oh see it mainstream is
over which it is. But this is

738
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,440
not your metric. This is Elon
Musk's bullshit number who knows

739
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,040
what that is it is review five
seconds, 10 seconds, 10 minutes,

740
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,780
the whole thing, what you know,
what is a view? And it's

741
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,650
completely meaningless. And when
we have these types of things

742
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:37,050
built in at the ground level of
what we're doing, it's 100 it's

743
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:43,680
almost I got close. I'll give it
I'll give myself a horn.

744
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,790
Dave Jones: I think you mean
ultimately. Yes. Ultimately,

745
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,900
Adam Curry: it's it's real
measurement. You know, and maybe

746
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,410
it's not public like those
bullcrap view numbers are, but

747
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,830
it's important and it's valuable
to the to the makers to the

748
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,980
people who are part of that
transaction, you know, and

749
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,850
that's and it's real and when
it's real and it's and it

750
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:10,230
involves real value is much more
valuable than some number where

751
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,920
people are because this is
coming you know, after YouTube

752
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,250
now it's gonna be Twitter's the
new place to put your podcast

753
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,480
you just watch so I'm gonna
happen in the podcast Industrial

754
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,220
Complex has already all jacked
up about it. I'm looking at you

755
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,150
rob Greenlake

756
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,190
Dave Jones: knows eject about it

757
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,230
Adam Curry: and I call them out
on Twitter. So what is it what

758
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,710
so what there's no RSS feed in
or out? What is the view? What

759
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,850
does it mean? And you know he
copped to it. But this, this

760
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,420
knee jerk reaction, oh, let's
let's just a new place. It's a

761
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:47,640
new place to go. Let's face it,
podcasting. This is hat tip to

762
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,620
Todd, a blueberry. The the COVID
period is over. When everyone

763
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,830
was creating a podcast or anyone
who had a podcast created

764
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,180
another podcast, we're back to
5% growth per year Slow and

765
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,310
Steady as she goes. There's no
more magic money, and certainly

766
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,990
not at Spotify.

767
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,750
Dave Jones: The this, this
brings up this brings up

768
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:21,210
something I've been thinking
about. And I mean, I think it's

769
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,740
I love this is out of the blue,
but I love the apple vision Pro

770
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,720
headset goggle thing.

771
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,420
Adam Curry: I love it too. But
maybe you're being facetious.

772
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,450
Dave Jones: I love I love it.
And I'll tell you why I am being

773
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,450
I don't know if facetious is the
right word because I don't know

774
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:45,300
what the definition of it is.
But I'm I love this product.

775
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:51,960
Because in my opinion, this is
the this will be in the future.

776
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,920
This will be looked back upon as
the poster child for when

777
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,560
everything began to fall apart.

778
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,370
Adam Curry: You mean like
mainstream media?

779
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:12,780
Dave Jones: No more or more main
that the the lie the lie of the

780
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,750
of the tank, the lie of
technology and technological

781
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,950
progress. Interesting. I think
the I think the bits the big

782
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:28,320
tech lie, is what I think I'm
talking about. Because the so

783
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,050
you have what the you know,
there's that famous there's that

784
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,080
quote about Peter Thiel, I think
we may have mentioned is we were

785
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,500
promised flying cars, and we got
140 characters, right? Yeah.

786
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:44,730
This is a this has been on my
mind a lot. And you know, it has

787
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:49,920
I think it's our I think it's
already started this this this

788
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,130
decline what you might want to
call like a slow fade of, of the

789
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,560
of the entertainment of digital.
Let's see how would you describe

790
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,000
like a it's like a slow fade of
the digital network

791
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,930
entertainment.

792
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,840
Adam Curry: When you went out
when you say network, what do

793
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,840
you mean, because I've long
declared the network to be over.

794
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,250
Dave Jones: Right. But I mean, I
mean things like streaming

795
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:24,120
things. Social media. I think
there is a general fatigue that

796
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,950
is setting in not because and I
think it was prompted initially

797
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:33,900
by COVID I think COVID broke
broke the entire world mentally.

798
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,740
I think we don't I think we're
all we all in agreement on that.

799
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,970
Yeah, we're in a we're globally
as a part as a as a as human

800
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,090
species. We're we've been
walking around in a fog for the

801
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:50,040
last 18 months, because we don't
know what to do now. We don't

802
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,800
know how to process this thing
that just happened to us where

803
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,120
the where our entire worlds were
flipped upside down temporarily

804
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,790
for a couple of years and then
supposedly go back to normal.

805
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:04,830
That's It's just not how that's
not how humans function. And so

806
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:10,800
that you began to see this slow
fade. And, well, there's a clip

807
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:14,280
abroad, I'm clipping again for
the second week in a row Windows

808
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,400
weekly, which I need to put
their value away. They don't

809
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,220
have a value block. So we'll
just have to play and then we'll

810
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,730
get we'll get nothing for this.
That's right. But this is this

811
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,150
is a little bit of a longer
clip, which I apologize for. But

812
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,100
I think I think it's kind of
necessary.

813
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,069
Unknown: But this is the
correlation with the PC market

814
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,609
decline. We

815
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,190
Adam Curry: are post pandemic,
yes, people are playing fewer

816
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:38,760
online games. Full stop. By the
way, we're seeing podcasting,

817
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,690
too. Incidentally. Sure. Spotify
just laid off hundreds of

818
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,250
podcasts, employees, our
audiences for all of our shows

819
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,150
is is down by 10 20% I don't
know what you're experiencing

820
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,040
Richard, you might be a little
protected because you're

821
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,190
offering something so specific
to enterprises. There's just

822
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,040
admitted sis admins, but I'm
with you. The numbers are off a

823
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,820
bit. Yeah, maybe 10%. And I
think that's, that's the that's

824
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,190
the same thing we're seeing
across the board. It's the end

825
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,310
the end of the pandemic, the
beginning. I also think the

826
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,190
weather's getting nice,
weather's nice, out and from,

827
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,990
from a point of view of
podcasting, but this is probably

828
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:18,030
true also of gaming. So you
might as well I stopped playing

829
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,180
video games look at this guy,
he's the source of the problem

830
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,490
now but that literally has
nothing to pandemic has nothing

831
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,930
to do with it. Like it like my,
my youth by listening time or

832
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,060
whatever, on podcasts has not
changed in the slightest, I

833
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,390
still listen to those things the
same times and places and right

834
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,460
lengths of time, as I always
did, because I go to the gym

835
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,460
most days. And when I'm driving
the car, whatever it is, like

836
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,890
that's, that's my time I usually
ready in the morning and I'm

837
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,210
shaving and stuff I for on a
podcast like I, I I'm a little

838
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,530
confused of that stuff. Timing,
changing i is a people suddenly

839
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,230
going back to work that I'm
gonna wear. But I feel like, you

840
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,480
know, you go to cities, and
these office buildings are all

841
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,010
empty. So yeah, I, I feel like
this stuff. You're I think

842
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,830
podcasts are a better place than
video games, because video

843
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:05,370
games, you're dedicated and have
to do it. But podcasts are

844
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:09,330
things that people can do in
those won't cast maybe as a

845
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:14,160
category. But individual shows,
including this show might be

846
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,410
suffering, because you know,
yeah, I'm still listening

847
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,960
Windows weekly, but not as much.
Because there's all these other

848
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,820
shows. And I'm sampling other
things. I think there's such an

849
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,430
array of content out there right
now and so many things to

850
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:30,480
attract your attention. That
every kind of, you know, thing.

851
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,250
content consumption, including
video games, is fragmented, more

852
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,620
and probably suffering as a
result. I don't know. I'm just

853
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,920
thinking, the fact that you're
not playing Call of Duty. Yeah.

854
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,100
You may say, Well, I'm an
assistant like I did for me,

855
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,880
right, like your stand, but
you're not such an outlier, in a

856
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,130
sense that maybe there's other
people think and you don't

857
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,830
really cut back on this gaming
was one thing for me to play

858
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:58,350
$600 of Val Haim in COVID. I
haven't I haven't touched Val,

859
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,560
every once in a while I fire it
up. And I go, Yeah, and I play

860
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,630
for a little bit and stop. I
think times have changed. Now,

861
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,840
can I respond to this briefly
for a second? For sure. The way

862
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,680
I interpret this clip is what
I've been saying for a long

863
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,570
time, is that the days of the
number one this the number one

864
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,590
that this is a must see TV, this
is the only place to be we've

865
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:26,550
got all the viewers, all the
people that's been over for a

866
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:31,080
long, long time. And television
networks, the only thing they

867
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,010
have is their phony baloney
Nielsen system, which is, you

868
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:40,380
know, creates an artificial
value in an artificially created

869
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,100
scarcity of content, because
that the linear, the linear

870
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,430
networks, where they only have
24 hours a day to make their

871
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:55,530
money. And secondarily, and this
is why value for value was the

872
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,740
only way forward in my mind is
you know, because because what

873
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,740
they missed there is the overall
recession that we're in

874
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,100
globally, which also always
brings down advertising rates,

875
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,650
that people just cannot
subscribe to, you know, 10 $20 a

876
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,190
month streaming services. And
that goes for podcast two, I

877
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:19,230
think podcast subscriptions,
will also probably be limited.

878
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,330
For that very same reason where
value for value, spreads it out

879
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:30,090
across the entire board. And
people are getting very, very

880
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,000
particular with what they're
going to spend their money on

881
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,600
what entertainment and when
they're forced into payments.

882
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,500
It's going to be a non starter
and that is for the reasons they

883
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,730
say there. But they're kind of
missing the missing the overall

884
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,440
point of the idea of oh, I'm on
the homepage of iTunes. No one

885
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,560
cares that your community and
you get out of it what your

886
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,000
community puts into it.

887
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,350
Dave Jones: See, I think there's
two I think there's two things

888
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,430
happening here. There's ech
advert we know advertising is

889
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,770
down, for sure. We know that
that's

890
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,720
Adam Curry: what got revenue was
up. It's crazy.

891
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,880
Dave Jones: It is, which is,
which is it's a miracle. We

892
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,800
know, we know this is the case
with with advertising. But

893
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,420
that's that's not necessarily
what he's talking about here.

894
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:27,660
He's saying, and and they are
concurring, that listener that

895
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,490
just flat out listening is down.
And that's, you know, the

896
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:38,430
podcast, the advertising piece
that is affecting us clearly

897
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:42,030
companies like Spotify, NPR, you
know, everybody that's led this

898
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:42,840
laying people off

899
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,660
Adam Curry: now just op three
confirmed that listening is down

900
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,230
overall.

901
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,859
Dave Jones: Yeah, I don't know.
And it could in this this is

902
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:53,129
this is where, you know, that's,
that's a complex question.

903
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,980
Unknown: i But yeah, I think if
I can just cut in my from, from

904
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,030
my perspective, I certainly
think, you know, if I look at my

905
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:06,000
own patterns, and you know, some
of my friends patterns where we,

906
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,590
you know, talk about podcasting
are listening is up, but we're

907
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,380
listening to a lot more smaller
podcasts, like, so it's more

908
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,710
distributed, like I think, you
know, you talk about, you know,

909
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,200
social fatigue. And I think
that's definitely true, but I,

910
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:23,310
but I think people are just
going to smaller communities.

911
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:27,330
And I think that holds true for
podcasting as well. Like, you

912
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:31,170
know, I think a lot of people
they maybe even find podcasting

913
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:34,770
true, the big shows like
something like, you know,

914
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,450
Dateline or, you know, cereal,
and then, you know, and, and

915
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,230
those big shows, you know, they
typically monetized but then

916
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,660
people, you know, they find out,
Oh, there's all these other

917
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,480
shows, you know, and some of
those small shows they're not

918
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,400
monetized. Yeah.

919
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,340
Adam Curry: How about this? How
about this as a as a off the

920
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:58,260
wall theory, because we all
broke during COVID. The thing

921
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,130
we're tired, and I certainly
have this, and I, I'm sure

922
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:06,810
there's a overall fatigue of
being a part of the mass. And

923
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:11,790
the mass usually is split up to,
you know, pro against Red, Blue

924
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:15,480
up down, you know, it's all
we're tired of being part of a

925
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,970
big group that fights against
another group, or just being

926
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:22,800
part of a big group in general.
And that, to me is almost as

927
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,310
certain as the pendulum swings
between centralized and

928
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:29,940
decentralized, you know, that in
technology, you see this all the

929
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:34,170
time. And I think, for the first
time, we may be seeing, or, you

930
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:42,570
know, the pendulum has been in
the centralized, centralized

931
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:46,860
sector for entertainment for a
long time. And now it's

932
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,670
decentral. You know, it's kind
of like when we had, we had

933
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:54,780
disco, film that's like, oh, and
then we had punk and we had ska,

934
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,170
we had Blitz, we had all these,
you could go into your list. And

935
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:02,250
then, you know, like, we in
America, we had Bo top 40 radio,

936
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,250
and then we had college radio, I
was cool to find this little

937
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,270
college station. Now, I think
that pendulum swings as well, we

938
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,840
may be on a massive swing
towards decentralization of our

939
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,800
entertainment.

940
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,280
Dave Jones: That That makes a
lot of sense. I think it also

941
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,110
fits. It also fits with my, with
my pretty pretty well, actually,

942
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:26,640
with my much general
inclination, which is my overall

943
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:31,230
my podcast, consumption is down
a little bit, but not a ton. But

944
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:35,940
my overall media consumption if
you're my media diet as a whole,

945
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:41,010
is definitely down. And it's,
it's because like, You're You're

946
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:44,220
a hard read on this, Adam,
because you this is your job. I

947
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,090
mean, your job is media, you
know, deconstruction. So you're

948
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:52,680
not really, it's not really a
clear, we're clear with you. But

949
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:56,370
like I saw at first with
Netflix, we dropped, we dropped

950
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,940
our Netflix subscription. And we
didn't drop it. The reason we

951
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,330
dropped it is because we went
like four months and didn't even

952
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:08,610
didn't even open the app,
because because it's almost like

953
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,750
they just simply ran out of
compelling content. Now,

954
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,680
Adam Curry: let me give you a
personal experience. Okay. Yes,

955
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:21,420
being a media deconstructionist,
I felt I needed everything. And

956
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:27,210
I had a $300 spectrum,
subscription cable television

957
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,450
included internet to be honest.
So that chunk of those internet

958
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:36,030
but it was outrageous. And when
Tucker Carlson left I was pretty

959
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,270
much the only thing I would
check out and not even regularly

960
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,030
my own fatigue because like he's
not saying anything interesting.

961
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:46,350
We, we cut it, got rid of it. We
got rid of it. And then we got

962
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,160
YouTube TV. And we haven't fired
that thing up more than five

963
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,760
times.

964
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,540
Dave Jones: Okay, see this the
end? This is this is what I'm

965
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,980
saying. And so I have I don't
know that anybody understands

966
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,230
exactly why This is but

967
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,590
Adam Curry: let me just
interject. Okay, we watch the

968
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:09,510
chosen on on their own app on
the Roku. And the other day, we

969
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,450
wanted to watch the K love
awards and got it not on YouTube

970
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:16,890
TV on YouTube, the Trinity
broadcast network. Very. So I'm

971
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:21,450
kind of more with Martin. Our
consumption is up, but it's much

972
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:26,970
more diverse. And, and you know,
and I'm I am, I am definitely

973
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:31,980
listening to more podcasts for
longer than I used to. Now I

974
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,000
have opportunity, I don't have a
commute, but you know, I cook, I

975
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,780
do, you know, dishwasher
cleaning. I take showers, you

976
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,810
know, this, this is when I'm
listening most of the time. And

977
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,990
I would say overall, the length
that I'm listening, maybe I have

978
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:50,430
maybe add one or two podcasts,
but the length is up. And I'm

979
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,770
also feeling much better for it.

980
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,730
Dave Jones: For sure, that's
yes, I would. That's for sure.

981
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:00,540
The case with me too. I think
there are, I think the big loser

982
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:06,030
in this is going to be general
media consumption, not that I

983
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:09,360
think there are going to be that
works. No, you're gonna have one

984
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:14,400
or two, or you're gonna have a
few big things this people to it

985
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,180
momentarily. And then it goes
away the days of people just

986
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,980
letting like, the days of me
just letting my Netflix

987
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,110
subscription go month after
month after month, and I'm

988
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,420
watching those that's over.
That's what that's not that's

989
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,110
not it's like it's like
scrolling endlessly on social

990
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:35,160
media when you don't, when you
don't have a purpose. There.

991
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,230
Like I think there's two
different kinds of friction that

992
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:41,610
happens. You have like the
initial friction of on. And I

993
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:44,850
mean, with an app or a service
or anything, you have initial

994
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:48,030
onboarding friction, that can
turn users away from ever

995
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:51,780
signing up in the first place.
That's one kind. There's another

996
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:57,270
kind of friction, which is a
which is a slow build up, a slow

997
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:02,820
friction build up over time from
ad load, other monetization

998
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,110
plays, the the original
structure of the platform has

999
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,570
changed out from under you and
you don't and you don't like it

1000
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:15,600
anymore. There is no longer has
as much compelling content. And

1001
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,370
that thing leads to this slow,
people just float away and they

1002
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,630
just don't come back it's like

1003
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,240
Adam Curry: going bankrupt is
very slow, then all of a sudden

1004
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,870
this really fast. Just turn it
off and modifies own note, I

1005
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,270
think confirms what we're
talking about here. The So

1006
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:37,230
forget all the stories about so
they fired 200 people which I

1007
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,900
think was probably two thirds of
their podcasting division, maybe

1008
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,380
even more, I don't know. But
here's how they this is from an

1009
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,130
adapted from an incident Below
is an adaptation of an internal

1010
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:51,750
update on Spotify podcast
business from Sahar Ella Bashi

1011
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,590
VP had a podcast business, and
Elon need to read a little bit

1012
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:59,160
in early 2019 We saw an
opportunity to invest in the

1013
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,720
small Okay, first of all, fuck
you very much in the small but

1014
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,290
rapidly grow. I'm sorry, I just
got that. That's one thing

1015
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:10,170
angered me, you know the
arrogance of these people in the

1016
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:15,450
small but rapidly growing
podcast space. And since then we

1017
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,960
have helped transform the
industry. Let's see what they've

1018
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,860
done, shall we? And this is all
the things we're talking about

1019
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,720
was what they feel they did.
Spotify is now the most used

1020
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,440
audio podcast platform in most
corners of the world is also the

1021
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,670
number one podcast publisher in
the US. There are now more than

1022
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:41,130
100 million podcast listeners on
Spotify and x growth. Since we

1023
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:44,100
entered the space over half a
billion people have listened to

1024
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,550
the podcast on Spotify.
consumption has grown more than

1025
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:53,400
14 100% podcast content has
increased from 200,000 titles to

1026
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:59,970
over 5 million shows on Spotify.
Amazing how amazing you really

1027
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,340
Oh goodness 165 of Spotify
original unlicensed shows, hit

1028
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:12,570
number one on our charts across
99 markets into 2022. Podcast ad

1029
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:17,730
revenue experience high double
digit growth from 21 to 22. In

1030
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:22,740
addition to fueling a revolution
for the medium, this massive

1031
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:26,460
group of creators and listeners
has also taught us an enormous

1032
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,730
amount about where podcasting is
today, and where it's going

1033
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:35,700
tomorrow. So first of all, what
they did is everything right?

1034
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:40,830
Number one, the best 10 hags and
they then why are they failing

1035
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:46,680
failed exactly, because that is
the space of humans move was

1036
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,450
moving in exactly the opposite
direction. We know that creators

1037
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:54,360
have embraced the global
audience in our platform, but

1038
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,340
want here it is improved
discovery to help them grow

1039
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:03,570
their audience And hello, Todd
Cochran, we also know that they

1040
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:08,490
appreciate our tools and creator
support programs, anchor, but

1041
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:12,690
want more optionality and
flexibility in terms of

1042
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:20,970
monetization. So that is what we
are doing over here, distributed

1043
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:26,940
smaller groups, it, most people
don't even know it. But if you

1044
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:32,340
listen to no agenda stream.com
This is a community of podcast,

1045
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,850
who are boosting each other that
hanging out together, it's all

1046
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,700
in the same chat room at all.
And they're doing it all in the

1047
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,780
2.0 apps. And it's a small
community, you know, it's a

1048
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:46,830
couple 1000 people listening
live at any given moment, if

1049
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:52,440
that, but it's working. In the
end, the value exchange is

1050
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,230
motivating, and they all love
each other and they're having

1051
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:58,710
fun and they're creating fun
stuff together, you know what

1052
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:03,810
that means? It means they're not
using Spotify, or Netflix or or,

1053
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,780
you know, MSNBC or anything of
that. So, I'll finish up with

1054
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,690
their final words, you're given
these learnings and our

1055
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:17,460
leadership position, we failed.
We recently embarked on the next

1056
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:21,180
phase of our podcast strategy,
which is focused on delivering

1057
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:29,130
even more value for creators and
users. I love that users too.

1058
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:32,790
Whenever you call your audience
users, you're a drug dealer.

1059
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:37,350
This begins with maximizing
consumption from the massive

1060
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:41,160
audience we've established
through format innovation, and

1061
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,000
ensuring that more creators in
more places achieve success.

1062
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:50,520
Adopt the namespace
simultaneously in collaboration

1063
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,890
with the podcasting community.
We are broadening our analytics

1064
01:06:55,890 --> 01:07:00,690
capabilities by expanding
Spotify for podcasters, which

1065
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:04,500
will help creators maximize
their audience on Spotify and

1066
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:10,950
beyond. underpinning this effort
is a continued leveling up over

1067
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:14,490
advertising offerings and the
introduction of more business

1068
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,750
models to help creators make
meaningful money meaningful

1069
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:23,400
money from their work,
meaningful money is value. I

1070
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,400
don't know what they mean by
meaningful money, but in our

1071
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,630
world is value. I would love for
Spotify to get their head

1072
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,690
screwed on straight, I don't
think they will, I have no

1073
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:38,940
illusions. But they failed in
the old system of being number

1074
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,360
one, bringing in the Hollywood
people to hire, you know, top

1075
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:47,070
talent. And it's that's not how
that's not the trend. The trend

1076
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:52,410
is smaller communities,
supporting the creative process

1077
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:55,710
with time, talent and treasure.
You can call it whatever you

1078
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:59,400
want, call it value for value,
anything you want. Even Patreon

1079
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,180
is a version of time talent and
treasure. So our subscriptions,

1080
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,990
but it's a little a little
unobtainable, I just don't see

1081
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,780
that as moving forward. You
know, people have to make

1082
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,800
choices. You know, I get emails
these days, probably received

1083
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,560
about four. It's like, Hey, Adam
and John Dvorak. I just want to

1084
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,400
let you know why I'm stopping my
my, my payments, you know, and

1085
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,860
then comes a whole story, you
know, of course, you know, like,

1086
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:30,030
lost my job. Tough times, right?
Tough times. But they take the

1087
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:33,990
time to send me a note and so I
feel bad about and our will we

1088
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:38,790
always reply it, are you kidding
me? You can help us in so many

1089
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:41,130
ways. It doesn't have to be
money, don't worry about it.

1090
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:45,090
It's not. That's not what we're
here for. Yeah, but the fact

1091
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,880
that people send those notes
means that there's something

1092
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:52,380
else between just a I'm paying
for a subscription. And that is

1093
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,620
and that's what that's why
Martin I saw you I think you

1094
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,350
were talking to Steven be
chatting on no agenda social

1095
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:01,800
that you guys were saying if you
if the Satoshis weren't flowing,

1096
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,140
you probably would have given up
a long time on this thing.

1097
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:09,689
Unknown: Yeah, I mean, it's
Well, I would say both the

1098
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:12,629
Satoshis but also you know the
messages to booster grams that

1099
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:16,049
comes with them, you know, in
just super motivational like

1100
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:21,299
yeah, I you know, after the
break would would pop friend you

1101
01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:26,279
know, I of course, there's still
people using pot friend even in

1102
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:30,089
that break, because they, you
know, somehow made it their app.

1103
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:33,839
But when I came back I saw
immediately people just jumping

1104
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:41,819
in helping tested sending
boosted boards. Yeah. Yeah. But

1105
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:44,609
but every little thing helps.
Like when you're with just one

1106
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:48,539
developer, you can you you don't
have a q&a team and even though

1107
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:52,859
you know, I feel like I probably
tested everything. And of course

1108
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:56,669
they're still you know, bucks
and in. There's a few people

1109
01:09:56,669 --> 01:10:01,079
that really went out of their
way to You know, testing some

1110
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:04,739
sent bug reports. And, you know,
if it was me, I would probably

1111
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:09,959
have even have given up, like,
si si back reporter because a,

1112
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:13,019
you know, I got I got reports
about the lb connection not

1113
01:10:13,019 --> 01:10:16,829
working. And I was like, testing
that. Okay, I think I fixed it

1114
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:20,879
down. And now it still doesn't
work. Okay, now, worse, oh, it

1115
01:10:20,879 --> 01:10:23,909
still doesn't work. Yeah. When
you have a third party like

1116
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:27,119
that, I can't see what's going
on on the LP side. So I'm like,

1117
01:10:27,509 --> 01:10:33,599
yeah, and enforceable crushing
it. Yeah. And then I, you know,

1118
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:37,499
try to add more, you know,
client side locking so and then

1119
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:40,739
suddenly, we could see what,
what was wrong? And Midwest, my

1120
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:44,969
code, of course, and it was
like, you know, one branch of

1121
01:10:44,969 --> 01:10:47,939
code that I thought it would
never enter, and, yeah,

1122
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,390
Dave Jones: I'm interested in, I
want you to come back to that,

1123
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,800
because I'm interested to see
what that was.

1124
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,950
Unknown: Yeah. No, but yeah, but
But what I want to say is just

1125
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:59,160
like the value for value, you
know, it really is time, you

1126
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,640
know, talent and treasure, like,
the time is so important, and

1127
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,210
the talent as well, like, you
know, sometimes people reach

1128
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:11,010
out, like, just want to help
improve things. And also, for

1129
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:14,220
example, the transcript data
library, you know, that it saves

1130
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,040
me time to use something like
that. And, you know, just plug

1131
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,430
it in. And, of course, I already
had some code that did something

1132
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,250
like it. But then suddenly,
there's an option like, oh, you

1133
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,890
know, now I can just say, I
always want to know 32

1134
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:30,570
characters maximum, you know,
automatically bundle, you know,

1135
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:33,720
those one word lines together.

1136
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,130
Adam Curry: Martin Martin is
also our first guest, who,

1137
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:43,560
sticking with the talent part,
who has been asked to select a

1138
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,280
song to play. So for those of
you listening to this, and

1139
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,490
listening in real time or
listening after the fact, please

1140
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:57,870
make sure you're using curio
caster. Pod friend, of course,

1141
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,480
is Has anyone else been added to
the list for the for the value

1142
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,130
time split yet? I think those
are the only two still. Dave, do

1143
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:05,550
you know?

1144
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,590
Dave Jones: I'm not sure what
you're asking.

1145
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,990
Adam Curry: Oh, when we play a
song for the for the value block

1146
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,620
to change?

1147
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:16,740
Dave Jones: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. No, I

1148
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:20,790
don't Yeah, I don't know of any
others. I mean, you said, you

1149
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,760
said Oscar is in progress, but I
haven't heard from him. It's

1150
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,540
still the only to you.

1151
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:27,570
Unknown: So. And the only caveat
is, you know, if you're

1152
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:32,190
listening on pot friend live, it
doesn't work. Because I'm, I

1153
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:36,420
still haven't hooked up to
Steven B's magical live stream

1154
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:36,750
yet.

1155
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,200
Adam Curry: It's all it's all
running with scissors. It's

1156
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,810
okay. It's all right. It's all
running with scissors. So why

1157
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,550
don't you tell us what you chose
and why.

1158
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,760
Unknown: So first of all, I
would say that, you know,

1159
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,670
looking for good, decentralized
artists and track to play. It's,

1160
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,430
I had to, you know, same
experience that I might have

1161
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:03,240
had, like 20 years ago, 30 years
ago, you know, going into a

1162
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:08,220
record store and looking through
through records, but no

1163
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:12,090
categories. I think, like it's
just, you know, judging by the

1164
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:15,810
cover, and then Oh, this looks
like maybe r&b Let me try to

1165
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:21,990
play it. No, that was techno or,
like, a track or something. But,

1166
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,370
you know, the I sent a boost in
your last show where I said,

1167
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:30,390
Hey, reach out if you know, and
only one person actually reached

1168
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:37,230
out and and that was Spencer,
who had, you know, I know, also,

1169
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,620
I've been supporting podcasting
2.0 For a long time, he's been

1170
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:46,230
joining some of our meetings.
And he made a album with a guy

1171
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:51,300
called April, April Kirby Herbie
Yeah. And that's called stay

1172
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:57,480
while and data to track called,
like wine. And he brought an

1173
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:02,550
interesting, you know, topic for
discussion. And that is, if

1174
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:05,640
you're, if you're self hosted,
then you can't appear on

1175
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,510
wavelength. You have to upload
all your music, and they

1176
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,550
actually put it like they're
creating a feat where they're

1177
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:14,970
taking 100% split for
themselves. And then you can,

1178
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:19,500
you know, lock in and withdraw.
And I thought, huh, and I

1179
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,680
thought, first I thought that
that's weird. But at the same

1180
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,010
time, I was thinking, Well, why
why? Why shouldn't they be

1181
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:29,850
allowed to do that? Like, if
it's if it's their platform, and

1182
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:33,060
I'm sure they're doing their
100% split, just to make it easy

1183
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:36,420
for themselves, like so for
onboarding sort of do have don't

1184
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:41,010
have to ask people for wallets
and pen things. But I guess you

1185
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,400
know, since a decentralized
space is so new, like it is an

1186
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,750
interesting discussion to have
like, and I also wondered, why

1187
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:54,270
don't they allow anyone to, you
know, upload them, they will not

1188
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:57,000
upload their music like hook
into their platform and just,

1189
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,750
you know, give them let's say,
two And percent split or

1190
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:04,230
something like it seems to me
that they could expand their

1191
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:07,050
reach. But yeah, it is, it is an
interesting discussion to have.

1192
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:10,350
Adam Curry: You know, and I
think part of that was, and I've

1193
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,690
seen this on no agenda, social,
you know, people well, that's

1194
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,540
centralized music, and that's
bad and new, we need

1195
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:19,710
decentralized. And I'm, and I'm,
and I will remind everybody that

1196
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:23,220
90% of you are using a
centralized wallet system known

1197
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,190
as git albie.com. So be careful
who you're pointing the finger

1198
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:32,130
at. But I agree that it's all
okay. And sometimes people need

1199
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:34,800
to start out that way, as like,
and then they say, Hey, you

1200
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,900
know, I want to have more
splits, I want more

1201
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,680
functionality I can self hosted,
I can go to music side project.

1202
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:47,100
And do it that way. I think the
market shows the way, the only

1203
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:50,550
reason why we've been playing
tracks, mainly, except for the

1204
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:54,030
last one, from wave Lake is so
that we can show the

1205
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:57,930
effectiveness? Yes, yeah, it's
been a marketing exercise,

1206
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,990
basically. And so we have a
great rep repository music team.

1207
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:04,920
And they do they do and, and I,
and we love them. And we hope

1208
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,170
that they figure out things that
work best for them. And we'd

1209
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:10,920
love to see a lot more of their,
of their music showing up in the

1210
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,550
index. And we're open to all
that's, I mean, this is this is

1211
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,880
really, you know, we're running
with scissors on this, but it's

1212
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:20,490
like those little baby scissors
you use in kindergarten, you

1213
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:25,140
know, it's like safety, safety
scissors. And but it's, it's all

1214
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,840
good. That's what's so great
about it. And so, instead of

1215
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,210
complaining, you know, I think
everyone can just do their own

1216
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:33,990
thing. I love the self hosted
music, which and the only thing

1217
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:38,190
I wanted is i, and we've kind of
we've discussed that is, we just

1218
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:40,470
need to be able to see what's
going on, we need a feedback

1219
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:45,330
mechanism. So that's coming. And
we love anybody who was involved

1220
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:49,140
with this, no matter how they're
doing it, it will come down to

1221
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:53,460
discovery. So how can I as a
podcaster, just what you said,

1222
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:59,190
Martin? How can I find a song,
so I use ln beats? You know, I

1223
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:03,390
also parse through, I don't
think I have a way to search at

1224
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:06,600
podcast index.org On medium
equals music, that would be

1225
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:08,250
cool. If there is a way to do
that.

1226
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:10,920
Dave Jones: Just yet on the
website,

1227
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:14,130
Adam Curry: just to be able to
sample it. I'm not quite sure

1228
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,920
sovereign feeds pulls in stuff
from I don't know where but

1229
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,920
that's really the way I do it.
And interestingly, when I do in

1230
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,310
sovereign feeds, I have no way
to test to listen to the music,

1231
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:27,000
I can find it all. And I can put
the value blocks in, but I can't

1232
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,240
hit a play button Anyway,
anyway, to listen to what it is.

1233
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:33,990
So this is all brand new. And we
have to look at it from all

1234
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:37,500
sides from the artists from the
podcast or from the app

1235
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,250
developer. But what we were
doing the feedback I'm getting

1236
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:45,600
from artists, and I've got some,
a couple of people who want to

1237
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,250
come in and do stuff with us
specifically for us, who are who

1238
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:53,010
have songs that are you know,
they have record deals, they

1239
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:57,090
want to do things outside of
that. That okay, and you know,

1240
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,340
so when we have a few more of
these, you know, when we have a

1241
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:03,870
few more apps doing this, we
have the live stuff working with

1242
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,890
this. I can feel this in my
loins. We are doing we're doing

1243
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:11,160
something this is gonna be the
focus of my bitcoin magazine

1244
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:11,730
article.

1245
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:16,830
Dave Jones: loins another great
word is like low lunch and moist

1246
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,310
I have

1247
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:22,080
Adam Curry: moist loins when I
listened to this song activating

1248
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,350
the block everybody there you
go. And we're gonna listen to

1249
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:32,580
like wine from Abel and the Wolf
from the album stay while

1250
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:43,140
Unknown: this day could get much
colder and gray keep to watch

1251
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:46,350
you go down the street

1252
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:58,200
to eat different money is not
the life of robbers to

1253
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:03,930
learn how to sleep disorder is
all the cells in

1254
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:25,140
vision just grow shot. Better
deer to cut you deeper to

1255
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:42,930
him through my heart blood water
through my head like wine even

1256
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:44,010
blinds me

1257
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:50,400
been through

1258
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,510
Hey

1259
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:42,930
so by not not outlawed so let's
see before we go was just a fact

1260
01:20:49,920 --> 01:21:02,010
as soon as you get in through my
heart blood water through my

1261
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:16,680
head like wine even blinds me
you running through my head

1262
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:27,300
out to me

1263
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,040
on my radio

1264
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:49,440
a kind dream Hi Evan

1265
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:22,800
Adam Curry: able in The Wolf of
podcasting 2.0 like wine with

1266
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,240
the value block being split
between April Kirby Spencer and

1267
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:33,870
blueberry gotta love it nice
love it and I had a rare moment

1268
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:39,660
back in the day you know on the
radio like oh I could finally go

1269
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:45,960
to the bathroom come on come on
did you go Dave No

1270
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:50,160
Dave Jones: no I did not go I
was as proofed by the livestream

1271
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,330
I've been here in my seat the
entire time but it's funny

1272
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,700
because there's an entire
alternate universe going on over

1273
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,330
here in this in the no agenda
tube livestream. I mean like it

1274
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:03,270
is they are they are
troubleshooting they are running

1275
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:07,710
with scissors as we speak
testing the value the Airheads

1276
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:15,390
lightning oh you blog plugin oh
all of Alex's no agenda to work

1277
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:20,130
I mean it's been a fantastic
test of the of the peer tube

1278
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:24,930
live stream experience this is
this was good but here's when I

1279
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:29,430
when I decided to do this like
you know we got to start with

1280
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:34,200
like we talked about the big one
that 2024 people we got to start

1281
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:39,120
testing this stuff because I
mean like the mean appear tube

1282
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:43,710
and now with with Alex and
Airheads work to get all this

1283
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:48,510
stuff going you know and so we
need we need to make sure that

1284
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:54,600
it works number one but then
what I would love to have and I

1285
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,960
don't know how to do this other
than just put it bake it into

1286
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,570
the feed generator that we use
ourselves is to have alternate

1287
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:08,100
string alternate enclosures. So
you know is to have the video as

1288
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,520
an alternate enclosure and the
audio is the audio is the

1289
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,980
enclosure video is the alternate
enclosure so that we can have

1290
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:20,940
both streams delivered in the
feed that that way people can

1291
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:25,200
flip back and forth that that
would be ideal I mean like right

1292
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,150
now if we had alternate
enclosure in our feed all of

1293
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:34,680
this running with scissors no no
generative stuff would be coming

1294
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:39,090
through as an alternative as an
alternate stream at the same

1295
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:43,050
time Oh, that time Yeah, yeah,
very cool. People get flipped

1296
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:47,520
their their video and see and
see me or and because the street

1297
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,570
the full stream and everything's
coming through. So like I mean,

1298
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:54,420
it would be it's a valid use
case for testing the alternate

1299
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:54,900
enclosure.

1300
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:00,120
Adam Curry: Oh, my head is
spinning. I did want to end So

1301
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:04,620
one thing about the Apple vision
pro why I liked this device. And

1302
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:07,230
I think it's I think it's been
missed read by a lot of people,

1303
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,690
you know, I had a lot of people
who were talking about who

1304
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:12,660
clearly didn't even look at what
it really does, oh, it's an AR

1305
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:16,500
VR headset. First of all, it's
Pro, when you use a pro, I

1306
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,130
presume this can be for
business. But I see it's there,

1307
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:24,060
they are selling this as spatial
computing. And I and this makes

1308
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,980
sense to me, because we went
from laptops, to iPhone to

1309
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:35,460
iPads, all different sizes, from
mouse to touch. I think this is

1310
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,090
the perfect device for the
future for the people of the

1311
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:42,930
future, who will be living in
their tiny home, which is a

1312
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:46,560
foregone conclusion, you will be
living in a tiny home, or you

1313
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,740
know, in a pod, and I like and
you'll like it, and you will

1314
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,190
like it. Now people are gonna be
living in a pod. So this you

1315
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:57,120
want, there's just no room for a
big screen, to watch your

1316
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,840
entertain. I don't think the
gaming aspect is such a big part

1317
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,290
of this, what I want personally,
and why I will purchase this

1318
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:07,440
device and I'd love for an app
developer who wants to work with

1319
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:13,200
me on this. My biggest problem
is space. I would love to have

1320
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:17,730
multiple screens from my podcast
work that I can rearrange and

1321
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:21,180
put in different spots. And you
know, I can see chat room I can

1322
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:25,440
you know, just look at it, it'll
highlight it'll come closer. I

1323
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,250
when I'm on the road, I slept, I
slept three screens with me

1324
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:34,110
laptops, all kinds of stuff, I
can see this as a total solution

1325
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:38,610
for building the ultimate
podcast studio the way I want

1326
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:42,570
it. That doesn't that I'm not
restricted to, you know, an

1327
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:45,930
amount of screens or amount of
physical space in order to do

1328
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:50,730
that, that I see as a big win
for me and I don't know, maybe I

1329
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:53,760
get my head I'll get tired. I
don't know if my Tourette's is

1330
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,980
gonna mess it all up, like
boiling point, boiling, have

1331
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:01,650
screens flying everywhere. But I
think it may be something the

1332
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:05,010
visual spatial computing aspect,
there may be something there.

1333
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,980
Entertainment wise, I don't
know. I don't care. I don't care

1334
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:11,520
about talking to people or any
of that or watching a basketball

1335
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,300
game. I don't care.

1336
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,280
Unknown: Yeah, I completely
agree. Like, it's sitting here

1337
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,310
at home right now. You know, I
have three monitors, I work I

1338
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:24,690
work exclusively remote, ever
since COVID. You know, we got in

1339
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:28,740
my company the option to be
remote. And as I just said, yep.

1340
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:33,570
And never looked back. And, and
yeah, I have to three monitors.

1341
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:38,370
But whenever I go, for example,
to the office, then I suddenly

1342
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:41,700
only have a laptop and it feels
like I'm like handicaps

1343
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:46,890
handicap. Yeah, exactly. And,
and since I'm remote, you know,

1344
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:50,310
I could go visit my family, you
know, and, and work during the

1345
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,800
workday, and then you know,
spent the time with them. Like,

1346
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,140
in the here I'm talking about,
like, my mom or my aunt or

1347
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:59,010
something, or even, you know, go
to the Maldives, or, you know,

1348
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,930
visit you guys in the US. But,
and, and but I'm not going to

1349
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:06,780
bring three monitors, I'm not
going to bring my keyboard like

1350
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:10,650
but here suddenly, you know,
yes, you would need probably

1351
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:13,440
need like a hardware keyboard
and a mouse, but that's doable,

1352
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:16,890
but then suddenly, you have no
as many money so as much as you

1353
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:19,800
want. And you can probably even
say, hey, now I want to go into

1354
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,150
like pot friend mode, or I want
to go into my normal work mode.

1355
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:27,840
And then it shows the monitors,
you know, you left open, like,

1356
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:32,790
also definitely see it as a
productivity thing. And I tried

1357
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:36,870
via, you know, way way, you
know, I just had monitors, and

1358
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:40,830
it does work. And that was even,
you know, extremely, you know,

1359
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:45,780
low pixel density, or is it high
now low like compared to what

1360
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:49,500
the vision Pro will be? So I
definitely think that there is a

1361
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:54,120
lot of potential, but looking at
the price tag, yeah, it's a it's

1362
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,350
definitely like a

1363
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:59,400
Adam Curry: well, you know, the
the way that's being explained

1364
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,010
is well, you're getting a
computer and you're getting a

1365
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,370
huge screen television, etc.
You're getting all those bits

1366
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:06,330
and pieces in there.

1367
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:09,930
Unknown: And that's fair, except
that you probably also have the

1368
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:13,260
other things like you will still
have a TV you still have not in

1369
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,990
Adam Curry: your tiny home. You
won't Martin about in your pod.

1370
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,170
Dave Jones: There's there seems
to be there's a couple of issues

1371
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:28,740
here that I see. I think the
biggest one clearly is that your

1372
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:34,470
your use case while completely
valid. Is such a small fraction

1373
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:37,770
of what they need to sell in
order to make this thing

1374
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:38,430
feasible.

1375
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,420
Adam Curry: Oh yeah, no, no,

1376
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,330
Dave Jones: it will it will
completely crash and burn that

1377
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:46,500
and the other. The other issue
that I see nobody talking about,

1378
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:50,820
which is I find it impossible to
believe that they have solved

1379
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:56,640
this is all augmented reality
stuff has the same problem. They

1380
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:03,630
lose state. They lose their kid
connection to the geometry of

1381
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:07,440
the space around them. And
before in it, this happens

1382
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,800
frequently, and you have to
start moving the device very

1383
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,440
slowly. Or else it or else the,
the, the visuals begin to jump

1384
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,310
all over the place. Like, I find
him very difficult to believe

1385
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,560
they've actually solved that
problem where you can move

1386
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,170
naturally without thinking about
it. And nothing, nothing

1387
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:25,950
glitches out.

1388
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:29,310
Adam Curry: They certainly
didn't show anyone moving

1389
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:31,890
around, everyone was static
standing at their desk or

1390
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:35,220
sitting down. The other thing
I'll say, and I'm going to call

1391
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:38,850
this a big success, not this
version, but this will be a

1392
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:43,470
success. It will, I think it
will, the way it would work for

1393
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:48,750
me, is I'm going into work mode,
or maybe it's entertainment

1394
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,660
mode. And the rest, I'm just
going to have my light phone, I

1395
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,470
don't care. Now I really don't
care. When when I'm in workspace

1396
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:58,710
and podcast space, I put this
thing on, I'm doing I've got

1397
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:01,380
everything there the way I need
it, I can do it anywhere. I want

1398
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:08,760
to do it technically, I guess,
philosophically. And then I can

1399
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,810
be completely out of all that in
the real world without any

1400
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:16,740
connection outside of it. And it
would really separate versus,

1401
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,440
oh, let me just walk up to the
laptop. Let me just check that

1402
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,830
thing on the computer. Let me
just grab my phone. I think for

1403
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:26,760
me, that's for me. I think I
think it'll be beneficial. I

1404
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,310
mean, the experience, I don't
know if it's there. I've seen

1405
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:33,240
some people who used it on
YouTube. And, you know, they say

1406
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:37,710
it's pretty, pretty remarkable.
So for my work mode for what I

1407
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:42,180
do, I'd be very excited to have
an app that is my podcast

1408
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:45,210
studio, and I've got all the all
my things there, including a

1409
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,620
mixer, everything.

1410
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:54,090
Dave Jones: Yeah, I mean, it's
fun. It's like, it's like the

1411
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,480
the device that you tried to
create a few years ago where it

1412
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:03,870
was, like it perfectly met and
perfectly met your needs. And

1413
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:06,690
it's like a well is there. But
that is the market big enough to

1414
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,190
just sustain it as a product.

1415
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,860
Adam Curry: Well, you know, and
then the Australian stole my

1416
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:14,130
idea, and it's fantastic. I
mean, yeah, I love watching the

1417
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:17,640
road caster Pro, I mean, even
the duo that's closer to what I

1418
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,360
was building, you know, to
build, they build that for 499.

1419
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:26,460
God, I love them for that they
built exactly what I wanted what

1420
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:29,940
I needed. And I think there
clearly is a market. But my

1421
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:33,600
mistake was thinking, you know,
I can, I can serve as that

1422
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:39,600
market you need hardware is
hard. You need, you need a lot

1423
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,900
more infrastructure and sales
and channels and all this stuff.

1424
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,780
And they've got that they're an
established company, and I was I

1425
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:46,650
applaud them for

1426
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:47,910
Dave Jones: it and see what I
hear, you

1427
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:52,290
Unknown: know, just just gonna
say, let's also remember that,

1428
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:56,400
you know, Apple is a, you know,
premium company, and you know,

1429
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,640
just as with iPhone, you know,
then if this turns out to be,

1430
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:04,110
you know, a success and they
will be half price. Oh, yeah.

1431
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,300
You know, we are set, you know,
that can do not, maybe not the

1432
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,270
exact same thing, but almost the
same thing. And maybe even you

1433
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:15,840
know, maybe they can do some
things better. I got the feeling

1434
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,690
that you know what, while
watching that video, and of

1435
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:23,490
course, some of it is just bus
right now, but I definitely got

1436
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:28,830
the feeling that this is the
start of something big. Yeah.

1437
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:33,240
Dave Jones: Yeah, I think so I
went the the visual glitch out

1438
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:36,930
thing to me is is, is a huge
deal. And maybe I'm wrong. I

1439
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:41,130
remember going to when, when 3d
television was first becoming

1440
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:47,550
like a thing. I remember. Go
into there locally, they had the

1441
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,070
college football championship
game. I can't remember what year

1442
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:54,090
this was the college football
championship game was on. But

1443
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:58,110
they were playing in theaters.
And so this was like an ESP NS

1444
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:03,330
big push to show off their 3d
technology. So there were they

1445
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:08,370
were filming it live with 3d
cameras. So you would go to the

1446
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:13,380
to the movie theater and watch
it. And so we we got tickets. I

1447
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,260
think it was Florida and Ohio
State that year. So we were put

1448
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,160
we're watching and then and we
had 3d glasses on and all this

1449
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,580
kind of stuff. And it was it was
neat. But then every so often

1450
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:26,250
the camera would the cameras
would go out of focus, which I

1451
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,550
mean happens during law sports,
they would go out of focus for a

1452
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:35,250
second or two and readjust. When
that happened. On a huge screen.

1453
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:39,270
You felt like your head had just
been turned inside out. It was

1454
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,420
like,

1455
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:42,720
Adam Curry: yeah, no, there's
all kinds of things that go

1456
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:46,530
wrong, but we have to actually
try it too. Hey, am I am I am I

1457
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:52,110
mistaken that I'm looking at V
for v stats.com. Is it B for B

1458
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:57,390
stats.com? Is that what we do?
Yes. It looks like overall we're

1459
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:03,240
up overall number First seemed
to be up like it typically it

1460
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:07,860
was like a million SATs rolling
through. Am I saying this right?

1461
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:12,750
Let me see. Now it seems like
we're at 2.2 million SATs

1462
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,820
flowing through the system per
day.

1463
01:35:15,809 --> 01:35:17,789
Dave Jones: What do you what
time period are you basing that

1464
01:35:17,789 --> 01:35:18,449
calculation on?

1465
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,540
Adam Curry: I'm just looking at
the seven days. Seven day okay?

1466
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,630
No no no no I'm sorry No, no,
it's different one um, I don't

1467
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:26,280
know why it just seems like it's
up

1468
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:29,850
Dave Jones: that I think it's up
in the short term it I think

1469
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:32,520
it's the that hasn't been
reflected in the long term yet.

1470
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,100
I think you can see that from
this Yeah, any day is beginning

1471
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:38,700
Adam Curry: Oh p 1990. days just
have a slight trend has a slight

1472
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:42,990
uptrend. If I drew a line it
would show an uptrend from about

1473
01:35:42,990 --> 01:35:46,890
4000 to 6000 whatever that's

1474
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,020
Dave Jones: called, would you
call this a head and shoulders

1475
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:49,470
pattern?

1476
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,370
Adam Curry: Sure, a black swan
event? That's what it is.

1477
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:55,680
Dave Jones: Open saucer is just
a cup as though so

1478
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:59,640
Adam Curry: shall we? Thanks
some people. Since we've been

1479
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,270

01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:29,550
value block. Okay, I love that
I'm not gonna mess around with

1500

talking? Sorry. 4321 for Martin
thanks for having me on the show

1505
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,650
would you kindly play the Hey
citizen Piano Man cover from

1506
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:58,800
last Sunday's live no agenda as
an end of show mix today. It's

1507
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,280
awesome. Yes, we're going to
play that particularly because

1508
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:06,300
this is more of an end of show
meant for podcasting. 2.0 it's

1509
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:10,860
five minutes. I can't there's no
value blog to put in for it.

1510
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:16,380
Also, it's it's licensed. So you
know, in the context of

1511
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:23,520
education and parody, it's okay
to play it in the context of the

1512
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,730
show, but we can't really be
boosting for it. But it is

1513
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,820
fabulous. Dave and I both love
it and we're very happy to play

1514
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:34,830

Martin pre boosting the pre show

1538

we're close to the delimiter so

1539
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:22,860
thank you all very much for pre
boosting podcasting 2.0 And

1540
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:24,600
we're gonna thank the rest of
the people who came in during

1541
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,110
the week.

1542
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:30,810
Dave Jones: We got no one off
papers this week transition

1543
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:31,380
Adam Curry: completed.

1544
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:36,930
Dave Jones: We're fully
transitioned. Yeah, we got none

1545
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:39,780
of those on the fret. I actually
need to I need to open up.

1546
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,410
Adam Curry: Oh, you didn't do
your booster grams. You were too

1547
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:45,030
busy setting up OBS.

1548
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,000
Dave Jones: No, no, I'm just
afraid I'm just afraid to open

1549
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,610
Thunderbird because I've got so
much crap going here already.

1550
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,050
Adam Curry: All right. Let me
just let me jinxes.

1551
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,280
Dave Jones: Like, let's see.

1552
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:06,180
Adam Curry: Alright, I got I got
some error on on Hindenburg that

1553
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:11,040
said you're going to lose data
the stream from the something

1554
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,500
and we can't it's not fast
enough. I don't know what it

1555
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,280
said. But luckily I have the
backup running. But now I can. I

1556
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:21,960
can see the the actual like the
it's hard to explain. But the

1557
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:27,390
recording cursor is moving
except now the the waveform is a

1558
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:30,060
little behind. So I don't know
if you've lost something. I

1559
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:34,320
wrote down a timecode I'll check
it I have a full lossless backup

1560
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,060
in case so no worries. Oh sweet.

1561
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:39,480
Dave Jones: Okay, well, let's
see this. This is okay so we got

1562
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:45,480
booster grants we got that
anonymous tu tu tu tu nice we

1563
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,970
get it we'll get well there's
multiple of those tu tu tu tu

1564
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:53,700
for for those so thank you
anonymous Mike Dell pod verse he

1565
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:58,080
says no name while no name while
live due to lb issues all fixed

1566
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,100
now. Oh, I guess he means his
name didn't come through. Thank

1567
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:07,470
you, Mike 1337 from Jean bean he
says to cast Matic is now going

1568
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:10,320
to have to try and find the
stream of Dave's doing the

1569
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:12,720
upgrade so I can see the
keyboards I'm a bit of a

1570
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,950
keyboard junkie to see that's
the thing it's a live stream

1571
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:19,980
it's ephemeral it's bad it's
gone you lost if you weren't if

1572
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:23,430
you weren't there, and it's it
didn't happen. It didn't happen

1573
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:27,720
tree falling in the woods Jean
been 4096 a four kilobit boost

1574
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:30,150
for cast ematic he says
regarding the multiple good

1575
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,310
resolvers it might be worth
doing something slightly more

1576
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:35,640
advanced than DNS load balancing
that takes into account some

1577
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,150
kind of health check to ensure
the individual resolvers are up

1578
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:42,210
and functioning. Yeah, we can
definitely do that because

1579
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:45,750
that's what we do already with
with POD pain. Pain we use

1580
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:52,020
Cloudflare to to load balance
and remove dynamically remove

1581
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:55,170
unhealthy edges, you know edge
nodes out of out of that and

1582
01:42:55,170 --> 01:43:00,720
also we can do the same thing.
Not a problem. Chaos 9911 Hunter

1583
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,860
says through fountain he says
I'm your D duping Huckleberry

1584
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:10,560
How do I enroll for the D dupe
army? We haven't even talked

1585
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,040
about this yet. And like I had a
good long conversation

1586
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:16,260
Unknown: with

1587
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:22,710
Dave Jones: Spurlock this week
about this about this very

1588
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:28,350
issue. And so we get we talked a
lot about it and I wanted I

1589
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:31,170
wanted to bring it up on the
show but we're I don't know that

1590
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:34,770
we'll have time is a big topic.
So we'll discuss the D duping

1591
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:39,570
and the index you know ingestion
and all that stuff we can do

1592
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:40,890
that we'll talk about that next
week.

1593
01:43:40,919 --> 01:43:41,939
Adam Curry: Yes for sure.

1594
01:43:42,809 --> 01:43:45,569
Dave Jones: You did you boost
45,000 says

1595
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:49,950
Adam Curry: Yeah, I bet Yes. See
that here's the problem, but I

1596
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:53,700
wasn't boosting us. And I bet
you we didn't get 45,000 because

1597
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:58,800
that went to Cory Keller from
pod pod friend I think right?

1598
01:43:59,459 --> 01:44:04,619
Dave Jones: Gotcha. Okay, yeah,
this the value times split

1599
01:44:06,150 --> 01:44:08,700
Adam Curry: now you see now you
see

1600
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:12,569
Unknown: that wait hold on. Yes.
Boost boost boost.

1601
01:44:13,950 --> 01:44:20,040
Adam Curry: Got to probably sent
another one to me. Yeah, I boost

1602
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,420
our artists are you kidding me?

1603
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,250
Unknown: Yeah, um, did you boost
during the live or after the

1604
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,720
episode was published?

1605
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:30,870
Adam Curry: No, I didn't boost
during the live I'm going to

1606
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:34,770
wait no that was That was last
week Martin and that was after

1607
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:38,310
was already published. Okay, not
during the live work. Yeah, no,

1608
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:40,770
that that one worked. I know
that one worked I tried during

1609
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:46,080
the no i don't know i boost so
much. I'm ball boosted out.

1610
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,120

you're doing with music at my

1614
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:11,850
local BTC meetup and I think
it's striking a note. I'm hoping

1615
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:15,270
to do a live demo next month she
could to showcase lb at the same

1616
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:21,030
time. Nice. Nice. Nice. We need
more of that for sure. Yep. 5000

1617

Brian Ensminger 1701 says to
cast medic says podcasting. 2.0

1622
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:49,890
Badgers are a great idea. Oh

1623
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,240
badgers badgers

1624
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,170
Adam Curry: badgers badgers

1625
01:45:56,040 --> 01:46:00,420
Dave Jones: let's see here. We

ducks in a row boost was at from

1629
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,220
Chris Fisher at Jupiter
broadcasting. That's

1630
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:24,240
Adam Curry: Bob Bob big, big,
big big shot caller

1631
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,010
Unknown: on a

1632
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:29,820
Adam Curry: combo. Nice. Thanks,
buddy.

1633
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:33,780
Dave Jones: On the topic of
YouTube, sucking out the revenue

1634
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:36,450
from the podcast advertising
space, it's already happening.

1635
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:39,750
Longtime well established
podcast sponsors are pulling out

1636
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:42,960
of podcasts for the remainder of
the year and doing just YouTube

1637
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:46,110
buys. Wow. Because they can do
them at scale. The individual

1638
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:49,620
deals with the podcasters take
too long, and the results vary

1639
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:53,100
too much. And they can't adopt
quick when the money is tight.

1640
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:58,230
So they are just expanding their
YouTube buys. Dudes trying to

1641
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:00,000
catch up I guess he means
Google.

1642
01:47:00,299 --> 01:47:03,599
Adam Curry: Is that and I'm
curious? Is that? Is that

1643
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:08,009
YouTube? Or is it also the evil
tick tock because I'm thinking

1644
01:47:08,009 --> 01:47:10,919
that a lot of us gotta go to
tick tock. All I hear is

1645
01:47:10,919 --> 01:47:13,049
marketing people who are
shifting their budgets to tick

1646
01:47:13,049 --> 01:47:20,159
tock. I wish I wish we you know,
I just I feel like we're being

1647
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:23,939
lied to and not maybe not
purposely. But you know, all

1648
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:27,149
these numbers about you know,
billions and billions serve

1649
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:30,689
billions of dollars and
podcasting, it just doesn't ring

1650
01:47:30,689 --> 01:47:36,059
true to me. It's got to be combo
with radio buys. And just It

1651
01:47:36,059 --> 01:47:39,869
doesn't sound right. And I wish
I knew that we could trust all

1652
01:47:39,869 --> 01:47:42,479
these numbers and make it I
guess that's the same with

1653
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:45,809
anything. You can't like I can't
trust Twitter's view. We can't

1654
01:47:45,929 --> 01:47:49,529
all I can trust this V for V.
That's all I know. I see the

1655
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:52,439
SATs. The Sats are there they're
in my wallet. They can't do

1656
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:55,169
that. No one. No one scooped
them up.

1657
01:47:56,370 --> 01:47:58,140
Dave Jones: And you don't know
who's being honest and who's

1658
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,130
not. I mean, that's

1659
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:00,900
Adam Curry: I think a lot of
people are not dishonest, but

1660
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,450
they're just taking numbers at
face value. It's like Oh yeah,

1661
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:06,900
1.8 billion. It's gonna be 5
billion by the end of 2020. For

1662
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:11,460
sure. Yeah, yeah, but yet
Spotify had to fire 200 people

1663
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:15,300
explain nothing wrong.

1664
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:16,620
Dave Jones: I see nothing wrong
with this logic.

1665
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:19,560
Adam Curry: Explained put that
in chat GPT

1666
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:26,160
Dave Jones: bad career advice
CEDD 3333 sets to found and he

1667
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:29,190
says the sets never come until
it has rained V for V love the

1668
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:33,600
tune. Thank you back career
advice. Chad 1234. Again through

1669
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,570
family says regarding
gamification of D dupe. Don't

1670
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:40,470
worry about sets create badges.
Badges are actually tags and app

1671
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:43,320
creators can do a certification
of activity against the tag.

1672
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:47,310
Then there can be batch specific
perks exclusive jam sessions

1673
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:48,450
just my two sets.

1674
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:51,270
Adam Curry: By the way thank you
very much blueberry or love you

1675
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:55,260
brother gave me a whole new V
four v logo on the fly I've

1676
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:58,620
already plugged it in and we're
going to save this publish the

1677
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:01,620
feed might even change for you
why while we're doing it I don't

1678
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,940
know. I don't know how that
works.

1679
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:06,180
Dave Jones: What is was is it
look killer? Oh yeah,

1680
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:09,810
Adam Curry: it's animated. It's
got like, blue clouds flying

1681
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:13,290
behind it and stuff is
beautiful. Let's be updated the

1682
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:15,210
feed I don't know if I don't
know if that comes through right

1683
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:18,420
away. But it's it's killer.
Thank you man.

question. Podcast guru. That's

1707
01:50:49,709 --> 01:50:50,369
what he's talking about.

1708
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:54,780
Adam Curry: Oh, oh, right. I
promoted that on no agenda.

1709
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:58,260
Yesterday. I said to you, oh, we
got fountain jobs like never

1710
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,900
heard of it. So no, it's pretty
big. I've never heard of it. How

1711
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:03,660
about pub? Never heard of it?
I've mentioned it 100 times. How

1712
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:07,920
about podcast addict? Podcast

brother.

1714
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,270
Dave Jones: Hey, on this
wonderful thing, he's open to

1715
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:13,200
new things. That's great

1716
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,650
Adam Curry: on the stream, is
that keeping everyone in the

1717
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:20,370
value block there with their
their value block tool does that

1718
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,310
does that take the value block
that I have for the live stream

1719
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:25,590
and and repurpose it?

1720
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,380

1730
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,750

I think we got some ideas on

1734
01:52:27,390 --> 01:52:30,600
Adam Curry: is s o r is the S O

1735
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:33,420
Dave Jones: Yeah, it's a
Gilligan acronym is just all

1736
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:38,580
caps. S O R. I don't know why
man Borlaug. I'm not falling

1737
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:41,400
brother. I don't know what
you're talking about

1738
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:43,650
Adam Curry: trying to think what
SR would be

1739
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:48,960

I'm out of ideas.

1742
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,220
Dave Jones: Emu Oil radio.
That's gotta be

1743
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:07,950
Adam Curry: oil radio. Standing
standing only room doesn't quite

1744
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:08,220

1745
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:15,300

1746

Martin music 2100 SATs through
fantasy. So is it possible to

1747
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:23,250
host publish and monetize your
own content from a start nine

1748
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:25,140
embassy today? Question mark.

1749
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:28,230
Adam Curry: Oh, very good
question. You know, let me say

1750
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,580
let me say this about that.

1751
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,720
Dave Jones: Looking at okay,
Jen, go ahead.

1752
01:53:34,349 --> 01:53:37,199
Adam Curry: I'm looking at IPFS
podcasting because I was just

1753
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:40,499
looking at this looking at IPF
podcasting dotnet I think,

1754
01:53:40,769 --> 01:53:47,279
actually it is possible. So,
now, I publish all of all of my

1755
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:53,729
feeds, I publish them all
through sovereign feeds. And

1756
01:53:53,729 --> 01:53:59,369
then that automatically gets
ingested by IPFS podcasting

1757
01:53:59,369 --> 01:54:04,439
running on the Start nine, and
it creates a new RSS feed for

1758
01:54:04,439 --> 01:54:10,379
me, which is identical to, to
my, you know, to the feed that

1759
01:54:10,409 --> 01:54:14,549
that I already have with one
difference. And that difference

1760
01:54:14,549 --> 01:54:23,819
is that all the media, in this
case the the mp3 is so here it

1761
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:27,689
is. So my IP is my IP Fs feed is
IPFS

1762
01:54:27,689 --> 01:54:36,779
podcasting.net/rss/three/podcasting 2.0
dot XML. And then in that he has

1763
01:54:37,319 --> 01:54:43,199
HTTP links to very long URL for
the mp3 which is a hash

1764
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:48,029
generated, of course, and it
goes through ipfs.io. So it's

1765
01:54:48,029 --> 01:54:54,059
using their common gateway. So
it would work. I think, you

1766
01:54:54,059 --> 01:54:57,659
could use that as long as you
have a couple of people pinning

1767
01:54:57,659 --> 01:55:01,349
your content which I would
gladly do that. by subscribing

1768
01:55:01,349 --> 01:55:06,149
to your feed in IPFS
podcasting.net. Now, the

1769
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:11,999
creation of your feed still
needs to be done somewhere. So,

1770
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,639
answer is not easily yet.

1771
01:55:15,419 --> 01:55:19,739
Dave Jones: This is this is
where this the solution. So a

1772
01:55:19,739 --> 01:55:26,699
solution for this would be if
sovereign thieves had an app for

1773
01:55:26,699 --> 01:55:30,479
the start nine, correct you
could where you could plug in

1774
01:55:30,509 --> 01:55:34,349
your sovereign where you can
take sovereign feeds and then

1775
01:55:34,349 --> 01:55:37,859
plug in an object storage bucket
somewhere that had a DNS name

1776
01:55:37,859 --> 01:55:41,969
attached to it. Yep, yep. Then
your gold and all you need. And

1777
01:55:41,969 --> 01:55:42,149
those

1778
01:55:42,150 --> 01:55:44,610
Adam Curry: guys are going clear
net pretty soon. So you will

1779
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:47,790
actually be able to host stuff
on the Start nine through your

1780
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:52,050
home connection, of course, your
results will vary. But just

1781
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:55,530
having a storage bucket gal,
you're golden and it could also

1782
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:59,670
be cast upon either one but
someone has to create an app and

1783
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:02,610
apparently is not all that hard.
And I'm telling you, I'm telling

1784
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:06,570
you to hear me now believe me
later. I am moving all my stuff

1785
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:10,380
to the Start nine we had a power
outage which was cool. Because

1786
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,230
it was the first time I got the
generator. Yeah, two and a half

1787
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:19,290
hours on a show day 7am I get up
and boom, I hear I see the

1788
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:23,610
lights flicker I'm like what's
going on and then I hear so the

1789
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:26,490
Jenny's running, everything
comes back including the air

1790
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:29,100
conditioner, which was
fantastic. The whole central H

1791
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:34,080
back and everything came back up
except my Umbral nodes, because

1792
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:37,440
I'm gonna who's gonna do a lot
to get those back up and

1793
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:42,240
running. But to start nine,
restarted, rebooted perfectly,

1794
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:45,330
all the services came back up
was just running. So I'm going

1795
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:49,320
to be moving and I have helipad
running on it which is an app

1796
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:53,040
now and I have a lightning node
on it and it's already I've put

1797
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:59,430
it in a couple blocks as a as a
as a test it's working fine. F

1798
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:03,780
word fine. So I'm gonna start
moving all of my my value block

1799
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:08,220
stuff over from the umbrellas to
the Start nine and I hope to

1800
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:12,300
have only that start nine really
running although the Umbro still

1801
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:15,630
has a couple of apps which I use
frequently and really love but

1802
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:20,160
at least the payment part will
go over to to start nine it's

1803
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,760
it's it's an OS man. It's not
it's not I mean, nothing against

1804
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,060
Docker strung together. But this
is a serious professional

1805
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:27,570
machine.

1806
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:35,490
Dave Jones: Well, that that so
so do you have on the on the

1807
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:39,450
Start nine? Does it come back up
automatically once that goes

1808
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:40,170
out? Like yeah,

1809
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,480
Adam Curry: yeah, yeah. Came
back out. And you know, we had

1810
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,640
Yes, it came back up
automatically. It was out for

1811
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:48,810
two and a half hours, the power,
it was fantastic. Love our life.

1812
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:53,550
Well, and because the router
came back up, but we've got the

1813
01:57:53,550 --> 01:57:57,300
fiber connection. So you know, I
don't think they have any, any

1814
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:01,080
power requirements until it hits
whatever, you know, wherever the

1815
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,390
fiber is going. I don't know
what the distance is before you

1816
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:07,050
have to amplify the light
signal. But it worked just fine.

1817
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:09,540
It just everything I was
prepping like normal. Can you

1818
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:13,470
imagine two and a half hours on
a show day I'd be in my car on

1819
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:16,590
you know, like driving towards a
Wi Fi spot? You know, because I

1820
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:20,010
need power. You know? Like,
eventually the laptop goes out.

1821
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:22,830
I just think paid for itself.

1822
01:58:23,519 --> 01:58:26,009
Dave Jones: I think multimode
fiber is like a mile or

1823
01:58:26,009 --> 01:58:29,069
something like that mile and a
half before SB repeated a couple

1824
01:58:29,069 --> 01:58:29,609
of miles.

1825
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:32,700
Adam Curry: Well, it weren't
maybe wrong. And of course I had

1826
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:38,070
the Starlink in case but not the
same experience.

1827
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,950
Dave Jones: Martin what internet
speed do you have in there in

1828
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:42,780
your in outside of Copenhagen?

1829
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:48,600
Unknown: Yeah, I also have fiber
so 1000 to 11,000 down. So

1830
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:52,980
Adam Curry: I got five gigabits
here people. Yes, swinging

1831
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,360
around, up and down.

1832
01:58:56,040 --> 01:59:00,300
Unknown: I think 1000 is like a
one cubed max here right. Now if

1833
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:05,820
I could get five I would have
five. So and also I just I just

1834
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:10,020
googled that server now and now
I want one. So the start Yeah,

1835
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:14,460
exactly. But But I am thinking
like, like think because I was

1836
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:18,690
thinking hey, could I save money
and just host the podcasts and

1837
01:59:18,690 --> 01:59:22,110
so on it but and I probably
could do I want to

1838
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:27,270
Adam Curry: know, just No, no,

02:02:23,850 --> 02:02:24,900
Unknown: Yes, shoot

1886
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:28,290
Dave Jones: dark mode.

02:02:29,490 --> 02:02:35,040
Unknown: Oh possible? Yes. And
our you know, I actually got an

1888
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:38,340
email about that today. This
morning. And

1889
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:39,330
Dave Jones: it wasn't me, I

1890
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:45,180
Unknown: promise. No. But it was
someone that says hey, I just

1891
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:50,880
love that but I'm getting
blinded by it. And, and it was

1892
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,570
also the number one request from
my wife. Like she she runs

1893
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:59,130
everything in dark mode. So like
he meets How many

1894
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:02,310
Adam Curry: guys have a wife who
runs everything in dark mode.

1895
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:03,780
Dave Jones: That's a keeper.

1896
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:09,030
Adam Curry: That's a real keeper
by the way. 77,777 from the same

anonymous coming in and St.
Martin Are you seeing that? You

there.

1900
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:21,660
Unknown: Let me just see well,

1901
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:24,150
Adam Curry: that's a striper
boost. I'll give a striper.

1902
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:31,740
Unknown: Yeah, my part of that
was just 7700 sets just right

1903
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,790
down into pug.

1904
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:40,050
Adam Curry: Wait and we got
another one another 170 7777 Go

podcasting. ADAM You said follow
us. Uh, no agenda social instead

1906
02:03:43,170 --> 02:03:47,250
of podcasts. Oh, yeah. I'm an
idiot. Podcast index dot social.

1907
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:53,640
Thanks for reminding me was
77,777 SATs podcast. I should

1908
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:54,900
make more mistakes.

1909
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:56,580
Unknown: Very nice.

1910
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,560
Dave Jones: Um, see? Okay, so in
pod friend the the Live episode

1911
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:04,920
art has already updated and I
see the animated V for V that is

1912
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:09,150
killer. Beautiful. I love it
with the storm clouds on it.

1913
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:11,669
Adam Curry: Yeah, that's the one
that's the one do anything. I

1914
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:13,290
Dave Jones: didn't refresh the
page. I didn't do anything. It

1915
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:14,310
just popped up. How

1916
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:17,160
Adam Curry: does that even work?
How does that work? Why did that

1917
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,080
happen? Why did that happen?

1918
02:04:20,250 --> 02:04:23,460
Unknown: So that so the reason
why that happened is actually

1919
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:27,930
because in the background, pop
friend updates to the podcast

1920
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:31,470
page every 10 minutes just to
see if there's anything new. How

1921
02:04:31,470 --> 02:04:33,930
about that? So yeah,

1922
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:36,480
Dave Jones: that's that's
beautiful. I mean, like I just

1923
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,600
flipped back over there to see
if it would indeed blind me with

1924
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:43,410
a non dark mode and it did but I
also got to see cool artwork,

1925
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:44,130
which is

1926
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:50,010
Unknown: the only thing is that
now the show cover art is not

1927
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:51,600
loading for me for some reason.

1928
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,960
Adam Curry: Oh, I actually I
actually synced it with the with

1929
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:59,940
everything. Oh, and that was
probably dumb. Tomas seconds.

1930
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:01,920
Unknown: Yeah

1931
02:05:06,509 --> 02:05:09,479
Adam Curry: show info. I know
what I did. Yeah, because I

1932
02:05:10,019 --> 02:05:16,079
yeah, I sync the whole thing.
That wasn't the smartest. Oh, I

1933
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:17,699
can I can fix that.

1934
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:21,270
Dave Jones: Dame Jennifer
entered the no agenda to chat.

1935
02:05:21,450 --> 02:05:27,330
Nice, nice nice to show this
this this is I'm gonna have to

1936
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:30,240
like lay down and take a nap
after this because it's

1937
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:33,900
Adam Curry: a little much for
you, David, I feel like you're

1938
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,940
getting fatigued you have the
rest of the day off. You gotta

1939
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:39,150
have to go back to the big work
week be workplace

1940
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:42,000
Dave Jones: rested day off. I'm
good. I'm good. I can realize my

1941
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,510
other question for you, Martin
is, but he

1942
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:48,810
Unknown: didn't get to say I
will be working on the dock

1943
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:53,130
mode. So within the next. But
when I say two two weeks or

1944
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:56,610
something, I probably mean like,
within the next month or so.

1945
02:05:57,060 --> 02:06:01,230
Okay. So the way the way I
programmed the interface, it

1946
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:05,040
should be fairly simple. Like I
keep keep every single, you

1947
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:11,250
know, variable in one big app
CSS state, like everything that

1948
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:14,340
is not standard. So it should,
should be

1949
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,920
Dave Jones: what are you what's
your CSS framework is like

1950
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,880
tailwind or something?

1951
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:23,130
Unknown: No. So I actually use
what's called SASS or notepad.

1952
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:29,730
Like thing where you can have
like nested CSS, so I think it's

1953
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:30,990
just sass. Yeah.

1954
02:06:31,530 --> 02:06:33,720
Dave Jones: Okay. Yeah, that
that, ya know, the one you have

1955
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:34,560
to compile, right.

1956
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:39,480
Unknown: Yeah, exactly. It does
compile like every single single

1957
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:40,200
time. Yeah, I

1958
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:43,170
Adam Curry: fix it. So the cover
art should should be back. I

1959
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:47,370
actually accidentally sync the
cool logo with everything. This

1960
02:06:47,370 --> 02:06:48,810
is only supposed to be the live
logo.

1961
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:52,350
Dave Jones: What up drip? Yeah,
dribs and drabs in the house.

1962
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:56,490
All right, it's a party over
here. PWA push notifications.

1963
02:06:56,490 --> 02:07:00,360
What about that? Can we can we
get PWA push notifications now

1964
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,430
that that's supported? Like
across the board?

1965
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,820
Unknown: So you're asking me,

1966
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:09,840
Adam Curry: you're not gonna get
an answer for me. Yeah. Every

1967
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,270
single apple will notify you all
the time.

1968
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:16,170
Unknown: No, no. Yeah. So that's
definitely something that will

1969
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:19,980
come at some point. Because, you
know, I want that. It's more

1970
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:24,000
that I have, I've never tried to
implement, like a notification

1971
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,930
that that's not like directly
from the app. So let's just have

1972
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:32,100
to figure out how to do that
best. It's probably super easy.

1973
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:34,410
I just, I just I just never
tried it before.

1974
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:40,590
Adam Curry: Okay, Mark, we were
at two bucks and eight cents.

1975
02:07:41,610 --> 02:07:44,640
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna I'm gonna
end the party. Now. Dave. By the

1976
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:47,850
way, Dave will be ready with
your booster grams. He will be

1977
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:51,000
removing a piece of clothing for
the higher the SAT boosters over

1978
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,940
there on his only fans. No
agenda Tube site.

1979
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:58,290
Dave Jones: Yes, fan to his
left. After the show. The party

1980
02:07:58,290 --> 02:08:01,320
continues as your fans I'm even
gonna log

1981
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,360
Adam Curry: in and check it out.
See what's going on. Martin.

1982

1987
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:24,780
Unknown: Yeah, I enjoyed it so
much. And it's good to be back.

1988
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:28,920
Like the, you know, people have
just been so great. So it's

1989
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:31,950
awesome. Oh, yeah, I look
forward to the future.

1990
02:08:32,490 --> 02:08:34,440
Dave Jones: Oh, wait, wait, I
had an ISO.

1991
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:38,100
Adam Curry: Yeah, no, I'm trying
to play it remarkable.

1992
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:43,140
I'm going to play the ISO and
