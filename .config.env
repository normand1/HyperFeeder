STORY_WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT_SUMMARY="You are tasked with creating a podcast segment that discusses a news article in detail.  Your goal is to present the information in an engaging and insightful manner, suitable  for a podcast audience.\n"
STORY_WRITER_USER_PROMPT_SUMMARY="Follow these instructions carefully:\n1. Begin by introducing the segment and mentioning the source of the news article:\n<intro> Next, we'll be examining an article titled {SOURCE_NAME}. </intro>\n2. The news article you will be discussing is as follows:\n<article> {NEWS_ARTICLE} </article>\n3. This segment should flow into and out of other segments easily and this segment should be modular and easy to swap with other segments, so no need to greet the audience. Include relevant information included beyond just the summary.  Do not include an intro or an outro, just jump right into the story. Do not say things like \"back to you in the studio\".\n4. Discuss the contents of the article in detail. Use transitions between topics to maintain a smooth flow.\n5. As you discuss the article, make insightful comments about the content. Consider the following aspects:\n  - The potential implications of the news\n  - How it relates to broader trends or issues\n  - Any unique or surprising elements in the story\n  - Questions that the article raises but doesn't answer\n\n6. Use a conversational tone appropriate for a podcast, but remain professional and informative.\nPresent your podcast segment within <podcast_segment> tags. Aim for a length that would take about 4-5 minutes to read aloud.\nRemember to speak as if you're addressing a listening audience, not reading an essay. Use phrases like \"As we can see from this article...\" or \"This brings up an interesting point...\" to maintain an engaging, conversational style.\n"

Incorporate humor, analogies, or relatable examples where appropriate to make the information more engaging and memorable.\n7. Use emojis sparingly to add visual interest and emphasize key points, but don't overdo it.\n8. If relevant, include hashtags that are related to the topic to increase discoverability.\n9. For the first tweet in the thread, provide a brief introduction that hooks the reader and gives an overview of what the thread will cover.\n10. For the last tweet, summarize the main takeaway or provide a thought-provoking conclusion that encourages engagement from your audience.\n11. Maintain a consistent voice and style throughout the thread to create a cohesive reading experience.\n12.
